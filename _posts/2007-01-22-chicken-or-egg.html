<p>I designed this banner several months ago for an email campaign. This weekend I came across an ad for bedlam that looks eerily similar. When I see something like this I always wonder if I had seen the other design before creating my design. Then subliminally manifested my version later, based on what I had seen earlier. Who knows. As far as I know, it's all a big coincidence.</p>
