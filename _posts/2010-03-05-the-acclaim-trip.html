<p><strong>Final Update:</strong> The car made the trip just fine. I have a good weekend of detailing ahead of me. The car must have sat under a tree for some time and needs a good wipe-down outside and in.</p>

<p>There seems to be a bit of sludgy debris in the cooling system which was probably stirred up with the replacement of the water pump. The temperature read a bit high during the first 50 miles or so of driving, but has normalized since then. A flush may need to happen soon. That seems to be the only major issue. At 38,000 miles, the Acclaim should have some good driving time left in it.</p>

<p><strong>Update 9:00p:</strong> We have a long drive ahead of us tomorrow. The car has been driven around town off and on today. It feels strong. We'll be stopping about half-way in Johnson City to visit a friend. Hopefully we'll make it back home before dark.</p>

<p><strong>Update 11:30a:</strong> <a href="http://twitpic.com/16yv5t">The Acclaim</a> is in hand. It needs a good scrubbing, but everything runs smooth. The location we picked the car up from had a <a href="http://twitpic.com/16yzrs">Tesla Roadster sitting in one of the bays</a>. Very cool. That's te closest I've been to a Tesla. I think it's presence is a good sign for the Acclaim acquisition.</p>

<p>The Acclaim is without spare tire and locating a spare wheel on a Saturday is a challenge. May hit up a junk yard. More to come.</p>

<p><strong>Update 6:30a:</strong> The plane awaits: <a href="http://twitpic.com/16xmrp">http://twitpic.com/16xmrp</a> An Acclaim fun fact: The Acclaim was rated third in reliability behind Accord and Camry in 1995.</p>

<p>We're flying up to Baltimore in the morning to pick-up and turn right back around with a 1995 Plymouth Acclaim with only 38,000 miles on the odo.</p>

<p>It's a unique find, but ultimately will extend the life of the Mooth fleet as all three of our vehicles are at the 150,000 mile mark. The Taurus will likely be retired.</p>

<p>Hopefully updates to this post will be frequent as we make our way to Baltor and back with our new old car.</p>
