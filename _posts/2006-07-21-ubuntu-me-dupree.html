<p><a href="http://ubuntucounter.geekosophical.net/">Count</a> your <span><a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a></span> install. I'm number 783. <a href="http://ubuntucounter.geekosophical.net" title="The Ubuntu Counter Project - user number # 783"><img src="http://ubuntucounter.geekosophical.net/img/ubuntu-blogger.php?user=783" alt="The Ubuntu Counter Project - user number # 783" /></a></p>

<p><span><a href="http://www.vox.com/">Vox</a></span> <a href="http://www.twit.tv/itn/mena_trott_of_six_apart">sounds</a> like the OS X of <span>blogging</span>. Supposedly there's a lot of AJAX goodness to make tasks simple. I'm still hoping for an invite before they open up publicly in the fall.</p>

<p>After a fitting round of ping-<span>pong</span> by <span>strobe light</span>, <a href="http://www.steeltoedloafer.com/">Ernie</a> and <a href="http://www.sweetvenus.org/">Jessica</a> and I caught a showing of You, Me &amp; <span>Dupree</span>, which I would have to rate as average. Oh, and there's something very odd about <span><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?oi=map&amp;q=Bellevue,+TN">Bellevue</a></span>.. I haven't completely figured it out yet... For some reason it reminds me of Memphis... which could explain a lot.</p>
