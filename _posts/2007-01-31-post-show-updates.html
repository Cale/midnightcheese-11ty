<p><a href="http://www.plowhaus.org/current.htm">My Bloody Valentine</a> went very well. A large crowd was on hand for a good portion of the evening. It was also good to see Jim and Emily again. The East Nashville area has really improved as of late.</p>

<p>I was late to post the show photo because I've been busy working with <a href="http://steeltoedloafer.vox.com/">Ernie</a> on an update to <a href="http://www.candorgallery.com/">Candor Gallery</a>. Hopefully later this week the new version will be released. This version will include a Previous button on the widget, but also a gallery on the website that will display all the works and artists with links to their respective websites.  All this in a nice browsable setting. So look forward to that very soon!</p>

<p>For all you Nashville folks, I received an email pointing me to <a href="http://nashville.ibegin.com/">iBegin</a>. There's limited listings at the moment, but the site certainly has potential.</p>

<p>Now I must return to Candor and the world of CSS goodness...</p>
