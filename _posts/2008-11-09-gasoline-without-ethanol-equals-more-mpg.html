<p>I recently found a local gas station that only sells gasoline that is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol#As_a_fuel">ethanol</a>-free. I've been keeping track of my mileage over the last several weeks to see what the difference is between buying ethanol-free gasoline vs. most gasolines which contain up to 10% ethanol.</p>

<p>With a good mix of city and highway driving during my daily commute I've found that I get up to 13% more MPG using the non-ethanol gasoline. I average 30mpg on straight gasoline while gasoline with up to 10% ethanol has ranged between 26 and 28mpg.</p>

<p>This certainly correlates with the fact that ethanol contains a lower energy content than regular gasoline.</p>
