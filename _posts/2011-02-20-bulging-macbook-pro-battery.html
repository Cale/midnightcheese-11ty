<p>Normally I swap between two different batteries when using my <a href="http://gdgt.com/apple/macbook-pro/15-inch/">MacBook Pro</a>. Today I opened a drawer to my desk to fetch one of the batteries and found a bulging surprise waiting for me. From the photos below you can see the results of some type of internal reaction.</p>

<p>Luckily, the reaction wasn't enough to burst the battery or start a fire. Thankfully, the battery wasn't in my laptop at the time.</p>
