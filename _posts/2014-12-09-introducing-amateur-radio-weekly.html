<p>While the <a href="http://hamweekly.com/">newsletter</a> has already been published for several issues, I recently realized I haven't formally posted anything about it!</p>

<p>With that said, today, I'd like to officially introduce <a href="http://hamweekly.com/">Amateur Radio Weekly</a>. It's an email newsletter published every Saturday featuring the most interesting links shared in the ham radio community that week.</p>

<p><a href="http://assets.midnightcheese.com/images/amateur-radio-weekly-large.gif"><img src="http://assets.midnightcheese.com/images/amateur-radio-weekly-large.gif" alt="Amateur Radio Weekly email newsletter"></a></p>

<p>The links will focus heavily on new technology, do-it-yourself projects, amateur radio in space, and anything else that promotes the ham radio hobby in a progressive manner. 10-12 easily scannable headlines generally make up an issue of Amateur Radio Weekly. Super simple, yet highly relevant. The ultimate goal is to elevate the hobby both for newcomers and established hams alike.</p>

<p>The weekly email newsletter format has been a success in internet technology circles, and I think we'll see the same for the ham crowd. (Thanks to those of you who have already signed up!)</p>

<p>Head over to <a href="http://hamweekly.com/">hamweekly.com</a> to sign-up, and if you like what you see, please share it with others.</p>
