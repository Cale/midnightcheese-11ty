<p>I accidentally broke one of my favorite glassed while doing the dishes tonight. I was washing my <a href="http://web.utk.edu/~urhc/">URHC</a> <a href="http://web.utk.edu/~rmooth/urhc2.jpg">Semi-Formal</a> glass when a large shard broke off and fell into the sink. The break sliced right through the silhouette of the couple dancing on the side. The dude fell into the sink leaving the woman standing alone still attached to the side of the glass. Very sad. It was such a clean break that only one single piece of glass broke off.</p>
