<p>The <a href="http://www.48hourfilm.com/">48 Hour Film Project</a> took place in Nashville this weekend. I was part of Order 48, providing a little bit of graphical support. You can take a look at our short film titled, <a href="http://www.midnightcheese.com/order48/">ANDY</a>. (20mb) All the films will be shown at the <a href="http://www.belcourt.org/">Belcourt Theater</a> starting August 2nd at 7:00pm. Check out the <a href="http://www.48hourfilm.com/process.cfm?action=show&locationID=33">48 Hour Film Project website</a> for more info and times.</p>
