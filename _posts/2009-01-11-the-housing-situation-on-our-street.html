<p>With all the talk of the housing market, I decided to take a quick inventory of the homes on our block. Of the 81 homes on the south end of our street there are 8 empty homes in some form of foreclosure, abandonment or sale. That equals about 10% of the homes on our street without occupants. Most of the homes have been empty for several months or more.</p>
