<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

<p>This past weekend was my first attempt at a Solo II event put on by the <a href="http://trscca.com/">local SCCA</a> chapter. A few photos have been added on to the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/midnightcheese/sets/72157600473081762/">previous set</a>. I had a multitude of DNFs until finally being straightened out by someone who knew what they were doing.</p>

<p>I switched our domains setup with DreamHost over to a new provider. This was a result of the <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/134-on-writing-managing-disaster-at-freshbooks-dreamhost-dancing-trees">prolonged intermittent uptime</a>, the <a href="http://www.midnightcheese.com/?p=449">lack of professionalism</a>, and the fact that they just really <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/287/dreamhosts-super-lame-no-i-mean-really-super-lame-apology">didn't seem to care about any of it</a>.</p>

<p>Been trying to plug along further with <a href="http://www.pencebook.com/">PenceBook</a>. Hopefully we'll be sending out beta announcements and our 'killer app' so to speak, in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Apple stock took a nice nosedive today. Looks like there's quite a discrepancy in the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2007/07/02/half-a-million-iphones-sold-vodafone-wants-a-piece-of-that-action">reported 500,000-700,000 iPhone units sold that first weekend</a> compared to the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2007/07/24/att-reports-146000-iphone-activations-in-first-two-days">150,000 account activations reported by AT&T</a> in the same time period. This should be an interesting series of events in the next few days as Apple reports their numbers. Not to mention <a href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/07/18/iphoneatt-billuh-oh/">bad news about AT&T's billing</a> of iPhone customers.</p>
