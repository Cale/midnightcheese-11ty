<p>We just recently launched the <a href="http://www.tapeonline.com/blog/">TapeOnline Blog</a> with the hopes of keeping customers informed and providing them with another means of giving feedback. I'll be contributing frequently, so look for a little crossposting action every so often.</p>

<p>I've picked up <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>. Even added a badge to my site. I really like the idea of basically having a continuous 'away message' type thing happening. It feels like it might end up being a lot to keep up with, however. We'll see how things go.</p>
