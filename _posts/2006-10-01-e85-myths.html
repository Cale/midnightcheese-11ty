<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.10/">This month's issue of Wired magazine</a> is debunking the problems associated with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E85">Ethanol</a> production and its use as an alternative fuel source. Mainly, the idea that it takes more energy to produce ethanol than the amount of energy ethanol can provide, the lack of land to produce an adequate supply, and the expensive cost to produce ethanol are all being rebuked.</p>

<p>The article will be available to read online starting October 3rd.</p>
