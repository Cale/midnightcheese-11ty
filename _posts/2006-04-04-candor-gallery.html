<p><b>Update</b> 04.13.06: Since Candor launched about a week and a half ago I've had over 150 different works submitted and placed into rotation, over 6,000 people download the widget, and over 56,000 views of the submitted artwork. As a result, there's some really really good work being displayed on a lot of desktops. And with such a great start I just want to thank everyone for their contributions. It's already much more successful than I imagined. Thanks again for the support, and please keep the artwork coming!</p>
