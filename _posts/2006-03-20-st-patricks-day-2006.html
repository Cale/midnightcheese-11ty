<p>Spent St. Patrick's Day in K-town with Ernie and the UTK Painting folks. Ernie beat me to the post both on the blog and flickr, but I'm <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/midnightcheese/sets/72057594086903162/">posting my photos anyway</a>. Ernie put up a few photos that I left out, so check his <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/72005902@N00/sets/72057594086870045/">stream</a> out, as well.</p>

<p>Saturday was a fantastic day for making that I-40 drive between Knoxville and Nashville. And an even better evening for having dinner downtown with Merredith.</p>

<p>I helped my brother move into his new place on Sunday, and with that, learned just how crazy housing prices have gotten, even in little Smyrna, Tennessee.</p>

<p>My left shift button has fallen off my MacBook. It didn't break off, jut kind of came undone. I keep snapping it back on, but my finger continues to slide it off every other time I use the shift key. Tomorrow I may finally head over to the Apple store  and see what's involved in getting it fixed.</p>
