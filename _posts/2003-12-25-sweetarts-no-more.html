<p>I'm saddened at what <a href="http://www.nestlesweetarts.com/">Sweetarts</a> have become. The green and pink Sweetarts used to be my most favorite flavors. Now, the green Sweetart is a horrific apple flavor. The pink Sweetart is now an unintelligible flavor which tastes even worse than the green Sweetart. It was bad enough when they added the blue ones. All that's left that is good are the purple ones. And I'm not buying a whole roll just to get a few purples. It's a sad day.</p>
