<p>Well, it's official. Analog is out, and digital is in. I went to Circuit City the other day to buy a cassette recorder so I could record a radio show broadcast over the internet, and later play it in the car. Well, as you can imagine, it was very difficult to find a plain old cassette recorder at an electronics store. I asked the guy working if he had any. Of course he wants to know "WHAT FOR??" So I told him about taping a show off the internet. His response: "YOU CAN DO THAT!?" He was completely clueless. So I explained how instead of plugging my speakers in the computer, I would run a miniplug from the computer to the cassette recorder. He was amazed.</p>
