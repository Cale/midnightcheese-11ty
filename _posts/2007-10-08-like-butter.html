<p>Somehow I've managed to drive 80,000 miles without ever changing my sparkplugs. This weekend, it was time. I ended up pulling the original plugs out which meant 120,000 miles on that one set of plugs.</p>

<p>As a result, the car now drives much, much smoother. It's actually quite amazing.</p>

<p>This weekend I also transferred music to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_SPH-A900">my cellphone</a> for the first time after 18 months of ownership. It took 20 minutes to transfer a 30MB MP3 episode of <a href="http://www.twit.tv/">TWiT</a> over Bluetooth from my laptop. The phone played the file back effortlessly. Unfortunately, the phone doesn't have a standard mini-plug out, so I won't be giving up my iPod any time soon for podcast listening during the morning commute.</p>
