<p>In August I had the opportunity to hike the <a href="http://www.summitpost.org/mount-mansfield/150938">Sunset Ridge Trail</a> to the summit ridge of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Mansfield">Mount Mansfield</a> near Burlington, Vermont. This was by far one of the most beautiful, yet challenging hikes I've been on. The trail starting from <a href="http://www.vtstateparks.com/htm/underhill.htm">Underhill State Park</a> was only 3.3 miles one way, but the 2,600 foot elevation gain wasn't easy, especially above the tree line. There are two or three places where pulling yourself up large rocks is required. <a href="http://www.mountain-forecast.com/peaks/Mount-Mansfield/forecasts/1339">Wind was a factor</a> during my hike. Hiking down the mountain the winds had picked up considerably, and were strong enough to push me down. Once below the tree line, all was normal.</p>

<p>The challenges aside, the view and the vegetation above the tree line was beautiful. All worth the time and effort.</p>
