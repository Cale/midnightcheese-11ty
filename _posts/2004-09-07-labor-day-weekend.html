<p>A good weekend it was. You can't beat <a href="http://www.cs.utk.edu/~fulton/boomsday/">Boomsday</a> in K-town, nor the orange sea of tailgaters eagerly awaiting the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=242492633">first game of the season</a>. I attended the obligatory Labor Day weekend cookout on Sunday, and then hiked <a href="http://www.tennessean.com/growth/archives/04/08/56486608.shtml">The Walls of Jericho</a> on Monday. Here's a <a href="http://assets.midnightcheese.com/images/walls.jpg">photo</a> I took down near the walls.</p>
