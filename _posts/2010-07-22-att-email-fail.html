<p><strong>Update:</strong> A <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23attfail+MI">Twitter search</a> reveals apparently everyone got the Michigan emails. Nicely done.</p>

<p>My contract with AT&T is up next week, so naturally I've been getting snail mail and email with various offers. Overnight I received three <a href="http://p.p0.com/YesConnect/HtmlMessagePreview?a=wCeje-sMrRqDB6wNqgvu5D9b">emails</a> from AT&T telling me I should visit some of their stores in Michigan and Indiana. Thanks for the info AT&T. Maybe I'll make that <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=nashville,+tn&daddr=713+S.+US+131+Three+Rivers,+MI&hl=en&geocode=&mra=ls&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=55.674612,86.396484&ie=UTF8&z=7">500 mile trip to Three Rivers</a>.</p>

<p>Over the years I've called AT&T a few times about the lack of service at my house. Maybe Michigan is their solution.</p>
