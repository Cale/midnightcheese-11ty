<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

<p>Well, today I drew my very last <a href="http://dailybeacon.utk.edu/cartoons.php/">comic</a> for the <a href="http://dailybeacon.utk.edu/">Daily Beacon</a>. For the past two school years I drew a strip for every weekday. I never ever thought I'd be able to think up enough ideas to be able to turn out almost 300 daily comic strips, but somehow I figured it out. It wasn't always pretty(especially the first year), but it was fun.</p>
