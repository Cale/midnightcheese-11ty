<p>Somehow my car was able to have two separate beverages spilled on it in the same day. This afternoon I left a coke sitting on the sunroof which of course fell over and ran down my windshield and on to the hood. This morning, some point between leaving the house and pulling into work I was able to pick up a nice coating of what looked to be fruit punch down the left passenger door. I have no idea how that got there. To top it all off, this evening I ran over a nail which is now slowly letting air out of my rear tire. Now I just need the engine light to come on... oh.. wait, that turned on yesterday.</p>
