<p>Aplus.net just recently hooked us up with <a href="http://roundcube.net/">RoundCube Webmail</a>. The other day I was wondering if anything will ever come along that surpasses the ease and simplicity of <a href="http://www.squirrelmail.org/">SquirrelMail</a>. Well, today is that day. RoundCube looks great and functions properly. I'd love to see a light mail application based on RoundCube.</p>
