<p>It's time for a change. As of late you're letting anything and everything get posted as newsworthy, all the while becoming increasingly <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/05/03/07/1152247.shtml?tid=114&tid=185&tid=95&tid=1">cynical</a>. That's assuming the news report you're posting is <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/02/27/1522245&tid=154&tid=218">even true at all</a>.  And what's up with some of these <a href="http://slashdot.org/pollBooth.pl?qid=1254&aid=-1">poll questions</a>? It's time to be a bit more objective. Let's stop pandering to the script kiddies and go back to the old adage, News for Nerds. Stuff that Matters.</p>

<p>And P.S. Please, <b>PLEASE</b> for the love of all that is sane and just in this world, lose the <em>italic font</em> on the story descriptions. It's PAINFUL. Oh, it hurts my eyes so!</p>
