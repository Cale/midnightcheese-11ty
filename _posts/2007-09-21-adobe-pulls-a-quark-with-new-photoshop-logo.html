<p>For <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/2007/09/photoshop_gets.html">unintelligible reasons</a> Adobe felt <a href="http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/photoshop_20_the_wrong_kind_of.php">Photoshop needed a logo of its own</a>, separate from the element logos that the rest of the Adobe portfolio of applications share. Enter a logo that's down right creepy.</p>

<p><img src="http://assets.midnightcheese.com/images/ps_logo_228x52.gif" width="228" height="52" border="0" alt="New Photoshop Logo" /></p>

<p>Reminds me very much of the <a href="http://www.underconsideration.com/speakup/archives/002412.html#002412">Quark logo redesign</a> that generated so much negative attention that it was <a href="http://www.quark.com/">changed again</a> several months later.</p>

<p>Is it just me, or does it feel like Macromedia acquired Adobe rather than the other way around? (I've mentioned this before in <a href="http://www.midnightcheese.com/?p=390">regards to their website</a>.)</p>
