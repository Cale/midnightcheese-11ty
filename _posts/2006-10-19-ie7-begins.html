<p>Over six years since the release of IE6, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/10/18/internet-explorer-7-for-windows-xp-available-now.aspx">Microsoft has officially released</a> <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/">Windows Internet Explorer 7</a> into the wild. While the 6 year gap is unquestionably disgraceful and sad, this new release will finally provide computer novices with a good standards-compliant browser. The GUI is still far from <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/">simple</a>(see graphic below), and <a href="http://secunia.com/Internet_Explorer_Arbitrary_Content_Disclosure_Vulnerability_Test/">security issues</a> are still largely to be determined, but at the very least, this release should alleviate hours and hours of pain and suffering for standards-aware web developers everywhere. An Office Space scene dragging IE6 out into a field and beating the holy hell out of it would be most appropriate.</p>

<p>Today is a good day to review the <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/07/17/BrowserDream">Browser Dream</a>(2003), as well.</p>
