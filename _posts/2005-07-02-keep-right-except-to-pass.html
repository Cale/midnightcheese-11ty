<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

<p>I'm driving down Old Hickory which is a 4 lane road, and I'm in the left lane because I'm going to have to make a left turn in about an 8th of a mile. Naturally there's a pick-up in front of me driving slower than the rate of speed at which I would like to be traveling. So I'm behind this guy... I'm not <b>right up</b> on him, but I'm definitely close enough to let him know that I'm back there and he needs to get into the right lane so I can pass. Of course he doesn't get over so I continue on behind him for this 8th of a mile until it's time for me to turn left. As I slow down to take the left he gives me the bird as he's speeding off. WTF? Obviously he was pissed that I was following him a little closely. If only he knew that you're supposed to keep right except to pass, he wouldn't have been in the left lane and gotten all pissed off when I wanted to pass him.</p>

<p>I'm convinced a lot of people just don't know this rule, and in some ways it's almost forgivable because they don't really TEST you for your license in Tennessee. At least not in Rutherford County where I was tested. At test time the trooper and I got in the car, we drove around the block, and that was it. I passed and got my license. I think the State should send out little tips and reminders to everyone along with their electric bill. Stuff like, "Just a reminder to keep right except to pass when driving!" Or, "Be sure to turn your headlights on when it's raining!" Just print it right at the bottom of the electric bill in a good sized font. I think it could really help things.</p>
