<p>After running <a href="http://fedora.redhat.com/">Fedora</a> Core 3 on my home server for the last 2 years, I think I'm going to finally put it down and try out <a href="http://www.linuxformat.co.uk/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=430">Core 6</a>. The built-in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIGLX">AIGLX</a>/compiz work looks promising. Running it on an integrated Intel graphics chip(82845G/GL) will be a good test. (Not that fancy desktop effects are really needed on this machine.)</p>

<p>I'm more interested in Fedora's wireless compatibility. I've got a cheap TEW-423PI working fine on an unsecured AP with Core 3, but I need WPA, and wpa_supplicant is giving me fits. I think it's more likely the TEW-423PI(or maybe just the Windows driver running under ndiswrapper) is a POS, and not a Fedora issue at all. But maybe I'll get lucky with Core 6.</p>
