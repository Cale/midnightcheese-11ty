<p>For the last several months I kept seeing all these <a href="http://www.go-metro.com/">Ohio Metro buses</a> running through Nashville. I just assumed Nashville MTA had bought a bunch of used buses and hadn't gotten around to repainting them (much less getting new tags).</p>

<p>As It turns out, <a href="http://www.go-metro.com/news/2010/nr16.html">Cincinnati has loaned</a> <a href="http://www.metro-magazine.com/News/Story/2010/05/Nashville-MTA-ramps-up-service-after-flooding.aspx">25 buses</a> to Nashville MTA to fill the gap from Nashville buses lost to the historic flood back in May.</p>

<p>A fine gesture of goodwill from Ohio.</p>
