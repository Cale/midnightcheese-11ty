<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

<p>Last night I parked my car in the 30 minute parking zone sometime around 7:30. I figured since everyone has moved out of the dorm I could leave it there overnight and not have a problem. So I left it down there until about 11:30 this morning. When I woke up this morning I looked out my window and could see the 30 minute parking area and all the cars out there had tickets on them for violating the 30 minute time limit. Well, I figured my car would surely have a ticket since I left it out there for almost 18 hours. I ran downstairs and could not believe my eyes. Every car around me had a ticket under it's wiper blade except mine. Here's what I think happened: Last semester we did a design project where we had to redesign a company's identity, so I picked the <a href="http://www.cia.gov">CIA</a> as my company. I made up ID badges and folders and such. But I ended up hanging one of those badges from my rearview mirror. I figure the ticket patrol person must have seen that ID badge and skipped my car. Either that or my ticket blew off my car and is laying on the ground. In which case I'll never know, it won't get paid, and the school will withhold my diploma as a result.</p>
