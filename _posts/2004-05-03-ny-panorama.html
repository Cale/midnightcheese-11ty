<p>I finally got around to putting together my <a href="http://assets.midnightcheese.com/images/NY-Pan.jpg">panorama</a> that I shot at Liberty Island in NY last summer. With the over exposed tile in the center, and the general lack of anything interesting to look at, it didn't really turn out as well as I had hoped.</p>
