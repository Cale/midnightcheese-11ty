<p>A former Apple employee has created an app called <a href="http://petewarden.github.com/iPhoneTracker/">iPhoneTracker</a> that pulls data from your iPhone backups in iTunes and then displays pretty much everywhere you've been lately. There's a <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/04/apple-location-tracking.html">huge storm of privacy concern</a> going on as a result.</p>

<p>You can certainly tell what cities someone has been to, but most of the location data is way off. Hundreds of miles off in my case. I can't imagine anyone finding much use in this as local data is grossly unreliable.</p>

<p>Here's my map. Larger dots are correct. I have been to Birmingham and Jacksonville, but the smaller dots in places like Northwestern Alabama and the central panhandle of Florida are completely incorrect.</p>
