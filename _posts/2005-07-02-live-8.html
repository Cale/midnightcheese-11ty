<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.live8live.com/">Live 8</a> is in full swing. I've been listening on <a href="http://www.xmradio.com/live8/">XM</a> which will be broadcasting everything, live. Everyone can watch or listen live courtesy of <a href="http://music.aol.com/">music.aol.com</a>. (You don't have to be an AOL member.) I believe MTV is covering quite a bit this afternoon along with VH1. Just <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/live8/">typing Live 8 into Flickr</a> also brings back quite a few photos from the event. There's a lot of good music to be heard out there, and it's for a good cause, so listen in.</p>
