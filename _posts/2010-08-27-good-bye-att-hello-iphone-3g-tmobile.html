<p>Finally made the big switch from AT&T. I've written a few times about the <a href="http://www.midnightcheese.com/2008/09/2-months-using-att-the-iphone/">lack of AT&T service at my house</a>. This past month my contract finally expired so I made the switch over to <a href="http://www.t-mobile.com/">T-Mobile</a>. The best part is I'm still using <a href="http://gdgt.com/apple/iphone/3g/">my iPhone</a> as my primary device.</p>

<p>Adding on to Merredith's family plan, I'm now paying $75 less per month. I get the same number of minutes, unlimited data and unlimited text (which I didn't have on AT&T) for only $15 more per month on top of Merredith's existing bill. That's a fantastic savings, and I couldn't be happier. Oh, and that also includes tethering!</p>

<p>The only downside is lack of 3G service on the iPhone due to T-Mobile using different frequencies for their 3G service. Surprisingly, I really don't miss 3G. <a href="http://www.pandora.com/">Pandora</a> and all my other regularly used apps still run as expected. I can still stream <a href="http://somafm.com/">SomaFM</a> on the 'High Bandwidth' setting without breaks in service.</p>

<p>If I do feel the need for 3G speed I can tether the Sony Ericson TM717 that came with my account to my laptop and surf that way.</p>

<p>But best of all, I actually get uninterrupted voice and data service at my house. T-Mobile's coverage is much better in that regard.</p>

<p>T-Mobile was also very easy to deal with in the store. They were able to tell us exactly how much everything would cost.</p>

<p>All-in-all, I'm very happy to be on T-Mobile. The service is excellent and I can actually use their product at my house. Imagine that!</p>
