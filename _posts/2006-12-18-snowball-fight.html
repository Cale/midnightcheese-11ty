<p>Smack your friends upside the head. For the last month I've been immersed with the rest of the <a href="http://www.tapeonline.com/">TapeOnline</a> crew in developing a Flash based game for the holiday season. This is my first game created with Flash, as well as my first expierence with an intense amount of ActionScript.</p>

<p>If nothing else, listen to the theme song we composed, but I encourage you go for a high score as well. Play <a href="http://www.tapeonline.com/snowballfight/">Snowball Fight</a>.</p>
