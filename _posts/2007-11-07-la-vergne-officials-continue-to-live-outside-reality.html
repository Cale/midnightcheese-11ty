<p>Our street was <a href="http://www.wkrn.com/nashville/news/local-cities-beef-up-patrols-for-halloween-night/126474.htm">featured on the news</a> again this past Halloween. This time for more speeding issues. (We made <a href="http://www.abc2news.com/news/local/story.aspx?content_id=5e0e4d27-d12e-4571-9270-ef1967672310">national news</a> a few weeks ago.)</p>

<p>Due to terrible city and neighborhood planning, our narrow little street is a main thoroughfare for the rest of our neighborhood. As a result, most drivers abuse the 25mph speed limit, cruising through at nearly double the speed.</p>

<p>Many small children live and play on our street so we've contacted the city on a number of occasions to ask for assistance in keeping the speed limit enforced. We've even had them come out to look for themselves. As a result, we have seen little help. From the news story:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The city administrator sat in my kitchen and witnessed this first hand. That was about a year ago. The only thing they could do was put more speed limit signs up. Have they? Absolutely not, nothing has been done," she said.</p>

<p>LaVergne City Administrator Mark Moshea refused to do an interview about the problem but said he plans to look into it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Granted, it's also the responsibility of the neighbors to respect others and drive through at a reasonable speed, but at the same time La Vergne is small. There isn't a lot for the police to do in this town. They could take some time to enforce the speed limit.</p>

<p>But hey, our very own <a href="http://thisislavergne.wordpress.com/2007/11/07/taco-supreme-crunchy/">Taco Bell just opened</a>!</p>

<p>Sad.</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> In february we had a few days of regular speed traps on our street. I spoke with one of the officers personally. People slowed down during the presence, but I haven't seen the police out again lately.</p>
