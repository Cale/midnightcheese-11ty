<p>Had the x86 version of <a href="http://developer.apple.com/darwin/">Darwin</a> running on my Dell for a little while... Then things got really bad. After starting XDarwin the system locked up and I had to reboot. After the reboot  I could no longer log in. Soon after that the machine wouldn't boot at all. When it did boot, however, it was really weird seeing "<a href="http://assets.midnightcheese.com/images/darwinscreen.jpg">Welcome to Macintosh</a>." show up on an Intel box.</p>
