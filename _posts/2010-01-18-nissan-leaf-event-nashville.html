<p>Nissan was showing off the <a href="http://www.nissanusa.com/leaf-electric-car/">Leaf</a> this evening. I snapped a few photos below. I like the prospect of driving an all-electric vehicle. The price needs to come down a bit, but for around-town applications, the Leaf sounds promising.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Nissan wasn't showing off the motor or the battery pack tonight. That will have to remain a mystery for the time being.</p>
