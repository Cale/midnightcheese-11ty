<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

<p>Metro Police in Davidson county have an unmarked darkly tinted Camry that screamed by me this morning, siren and hidden lights flashing. That's the first time I've ever seen a police vehicle that wasn't domestic.</p>

<p>One more model and make for you lead foot folks to watch out for.</p>
