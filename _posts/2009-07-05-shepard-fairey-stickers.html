<p>In 2000 I had the chance to interview <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepard_Fairey">Shepard Fairey</a> over the phone as a Graphic Design project for school.</p>

<p>I remember the most interesting aspect of the interview was Mr. Fairey talking about the balance between his <a href="http://obeygiant.com/">street art</a> and <a href="http://www.blkmrkt.com/">commercial</a> <a href="http://studionumber-one.com/">art</a>. He said he would often cover up his commerical art (billboards) with street art.</p>

<p>He sent me an envelope of stickers a few days later. These are the stickers I held on to from that mailing. The rest have been stuck elsewhere.</p>
