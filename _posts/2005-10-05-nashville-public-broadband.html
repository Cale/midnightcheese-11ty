<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.nashville.gov/council/">The Metro Council</a> will be <a href="http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051005/BUSINESS01/51005001">researching the feasibility</a> of a public broadband network for Davidson county. This is exactly what the local government should be doing with tax money. Apply it to a public utility that the entire city can <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,57927,00.html">benefit</a> from. Without the incentive to make a profit, a public broadband network paid for by tax payers will largely undercut the $55 a month that Comcast requires for access to their network. Of course <a href="http://www.tcta.net/">TCTA</a> is upset. The local government/public/citizens of this county are moving toward breaking up the Comcast/Bellsouth monopoly on broadband internet. If the <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/08/07/1240206&tid=123&tid=215&tid=95">FCC won't do it</a>, it's left up to the people to take action.</p>

<p>We'll see how far this initiative gets.</p>
