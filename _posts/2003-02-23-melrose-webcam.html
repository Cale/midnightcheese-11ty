<p>The <a href="http://web.utk.edu/~rmooth/webcam.html">Hess Hall Webcam</a> lives on, in a way. I came across a <a href="http://cam1.asa.utk.edu/view/view.shtml">webcam</a> located at <a href="http://web.utk.edu/~reshalls/info/resh/melrose.html">Melrose Hall</a>, which is right next door to <a href="http://web.utk.edu/~reshalls/info/resh/hess.html">Hess Hall</a>. The view is pointing down the same street <a href="http://web.utk.edu/~rmooth/highlights/protest.jpg">my webcam pointed</a> only in the opposite direction. It's a very nice camera, too. I'd love to have one of those <a href="http://www.axis.com/products/cam_2100/index.htm">Axis Network Cameras</a>.</p>
