<p>I'm sure this isn't very exciting to most people, but I just have to say how amazing the <a href="http://www.yeahyeahyeahs.com/">Yeah Yeah Yeahs</a>' Fever to Tell album is. I know its been out a while, but their sound, her voice... amazing. I have to make myself not listen too often so I don't get burned out on it.</p>
