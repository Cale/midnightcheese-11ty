<p>The homemade DTV antenna has been assembled and installed. Everything seems to be working well. All the local channels tune-in just fine. My TV doesn't display signal strength, so I don't really have any way of knowing if the signal is any stronger compared to the rabbit-ears. But it does get rid of the ugly antenna in the living room.</p>

<p>I placed the antenna in the attic above the garage and set-up an A-B switch to allow switching the living room TV between antenna and cable, should we ever subscribe to Comcast again.</p>

<p>Larger washers might be helpful, but other than that, the <a href="http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2009/01/maker_workshop_dtv_antenna_steadyca.html?CMP=OTC-0D6B48984890">Make instructions worked out well</a>.</p>
