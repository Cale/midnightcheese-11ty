<p>I had the opportunity to use a <a href="http://www.solarcellsales.com/techinfo/docs/sr100p1.pdf">Siemens 100 watt panel</a>[pdf] from <a href="http://www.tapeonline.com/">work</a> and build a small setup that I'm currently using to power my cable modem and wireless router at home.</p>

<p>It's a simple setup. The 100 watt panel:</p>

<p>Which connects to the power regulator. This prevents the battery from being overcharged:</p>

<p>The regulator connects to the battery. I'm using a marine deep-cycle 75 amp hour battery from Wal-Mart.</p>

<p><a href="http://assets.midnightcheese.com/images/marine-battery-big.jpg"><img src="http://assets.midnightcheese.com/images/marine-battery-big.jpg" border="0" class="blogImage" alt="marine battery" /></a><br /><small>75 amp/hr deep-cycle marine battery</small></p>

<p>Connected to the battery is an inverter which allows me to power standard AC devices.</p>

<p><a href="http://assets.midnightcheese.com/images/cobra-inverter-big.jpg"><img src="http://assets.midnightcheese.com/images/cobra-inverter-big.jpg" border="0" class="blogImage" alt="Cobra power inverter" /></a><br /><small>Cobra 400 watt inverter</small></p>

<p>The total power draw from the connected devices, including the 0.5 amperes used by the inverter equals 1.65 amperes. If my math is right, the 75 amp/hr battery should power the modem and router for 45 hours if the battery were allowed to drain completely.</p>

<p>In actual use the modem and router drain the battery to around 60% overnight. If the sky stays sunny, the solar panel provides more than enough energy to recharge the battery each day.</p>

<p>The panel itself is not in an optimal position. It probably misses 3 hours of morning sunlight, then maybe another hour or two of late afternoon sun due to its location on the ground. It's also not properly angled.</p>

<p>Solar panels connected to a battery pack can be a great system, but the current cost for solar panels really puts a robust system out of reach for a lot of people. The solar industry says $1.00 per watt is were these systems need to be in terms of cost. I'd like to see half that. A 3,000 watt non-battery system that ties directly into your home grid for around $3,000 with an inverter (not including labor costs) would be fantastic.</p>

<p>As for my little system, it's a lot of fun to have even a tiny portion of my home being powered off the grid, even though I'll never see a difference in my electric bill. I don't know enough about batteries, so I worry about having one inside the house. I monitor its level constantly, never letting the battery get below 50%. I need to get a battery box, but with the gases that the battery gives off, I just don't know how much of a concern that is with the inverter being so close-by.</p>
