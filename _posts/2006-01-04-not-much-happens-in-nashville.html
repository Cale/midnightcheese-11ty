<p>Thanks to everyone <a href="http://www.cctv.tdot.state.tn.us/CCTVNASH/cam55.htm">South of town on I-24W</a> this morning around 9:00 who felt the need to crawl to a stop for some sawdust on the road that was acting as a clean-up device from an accident that occurred 3 hours and 15 minutes earlier. I enjoyed the phenomena of traffic being backed up for miles and miles.</p>
