<p>According to <a href="http://knoxville.about.com/citiestowns/southeastus/knoxville/mbiopage.htm">Melany Noltenius</a> at <a href="http://www.about.com">About.com</a>, my webcam is one of the many "<a href="http://knoxville.about.com/citiestowns/southeastus/knoxville/library/weekly/aa082300a.htm">Nosy Neighbors in Knoxville</a>." <i>"Warning to Hess Hall Students - Don't neck in the courtyard, you are not alone!"</i> Yeah... that's pretty far out there, but hey, the webcam is mentioned in About.com.
