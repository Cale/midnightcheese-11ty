<p>A flip button? Are you serious? It looks like they literally glued a phone and an MP3 player together. There's zero cohesiveness to this thing. Could the extended battery be any more awkward? The video associated with the <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/Samsung_Upstage_SPH_M620/4505-6454_7-32378893.html?tag=box">Samsung Upstage review on CNET</a> is worth looking at. I'm not sure what they based that 8 of 10 review on, however.</p>

<p>Already tons of <a href="http://www.appletvhacks.net/">hacks</a> available with the AppleTV. From using it as a server to getting it to play more <a href="http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?s=&threadid=2391956">codecs</a>, you can also upgrade the HD to something much larger.</p>
