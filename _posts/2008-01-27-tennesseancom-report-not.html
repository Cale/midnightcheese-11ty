<p>I routinely browse newspaper websites from many cities across the country(and the globe for that matter) but usually skip over the <a href="http://www.tennessean.com/">Nashville paper</a> because they rarely report on anything relevant to the moment. This morning is no exception.</p>

<p>Interestingly, around 9:30am on Sunday morning <a href="http://www.tennessean.com/">Tennessean.com</a> has no mention of the South Carolina Primary on the home page. Maybe I'm crazy, but I would think people in Nashville would want to know what's going on in a state like South Carolina which is not only 50 miles from our border but also shares many similar regional qualities. For instance, are S.C.'s results a precursor to those in Tennessee? Why or why not?</p>

<p>If that's too much effort at least throw an AP story up front so we at least know what the results were.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.commercialappeal.com/">Memphis</a> and <a href="http://knoxnews.com/">Knoxville</a> papers were talking about it. Chattanooga however, was on to much, <a href="http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2008/jan/27/here-comes-fuzz-mustaches-police/">much bigger things</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, Tennessean.com recently took on a new look. It's a step up, but they're still providing problems for <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> viewers:</p>
