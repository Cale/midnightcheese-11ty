<p>Driving back from snowboarding in NC, we listened to music on <a href="http://www.electric949.com/">94.9</a> in East Tennessee. In between sets the DJ was asking people to call in and try to guess what people who live in the mountains are three times as likely to do per day. So for at least an hour this goes on with people calling in giving all sorts of guesses. Finally after no one can call in with the correct answer the DJ joyfully tells us that people who live in the mountains are three times as likely to eat a cookie everyday. Now, naturally, upon hearing this statement one might wonder WHY people who live in the mountains are 3 times as likely to eat a cookie every day. Well, no reason was given, no explanation was stated. That was it. WTF?? How mindless is that not to give any kind of explanation for which all these people spent their time racking their brains in order to try to answer this question? It was truly a Lewis Black/If it weren't for my horse, moment.</p>
