<p>Midnight Cheese finally has a fresh face. The last look held on for almost 2 full years. With the upgrade I've managed to shave off 100KB of code and markup. That tidbit might be my favorite part of the refresh!</p>

<p>There are a couple areas that still need some style applied. (The comments for example.) I also haven't done any IE testing yet, so I'm sure there will be some CSS tweaking in order to make the dark side conform.</p>

<p>Here are some screens comparing stats between old(242KB) and new(142KB).</p>
