<p>I'm finding <a href="http://www.panic.com/coda/">Coda</a> to be very useful. No more switching between Transmit and TextMate.</p>

<p>I tried to upgrade to <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> 7.04 on my desktop machine using the software update app. Sadly, it completely hosed my install when it errored out in the middle of the update. This was after I had to modify the installer package which was complaining about <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=414639&page=2&highlight=upgrade+-enough+free+space">not having enough free hard disk space on /boot</a>.</p>

<p>Finally I did a full install from CD. Desktop effects are nice. I still had to manually edit xorg.conf to support my widescreen display. So unfortunately Ubuntu is still not ready for everyday computer users.</p>

<p>Take the <a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/webdesignsurvey">A List Apart Web Design Survey</a>.</p>

<p>The record industry continues to <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070416-internet-radio-dealt-severe-blow-as-copyright-board-rejects-appeal.html">cut itself out of existence</a>.</p>

<p>When I was a kid my Dad somehow came up with a copy of Mike Jittlov's short <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0796238/">The Wizard of Speed and Time</a>. Recently I came across it again <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZElVf8ld3T0">on YouTube</a>. Pretty amazing for 1979.</p>
