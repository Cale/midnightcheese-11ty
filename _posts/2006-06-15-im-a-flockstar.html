<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

<p>I'm not diggin' the "<a href="http://www.flock.com/flockstar-submission">Flockstar</a>" marketing idea(sounds very 13-year-old MTV crowd), but <a href="http://www.flock.com/">Flock</a> is quickly becoming my browser of choice. With built-in blogging, Flickr and RSS tools, they have the potential to eliminate the need for separate apps like <a href="http://ranchero.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a>, Flickr Uploader, and <a href="http://www.newsfirerss.com/">NewsFire</a>.</p>
