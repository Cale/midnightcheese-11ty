<p>I can't tell you how excited I am to have been selected to attend a <a href=" intriguing">NASA Social</a> event featuring the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_CRS-4">fourth launch of SpaceX's Dragon capsule to resupply ISS</a>. After <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/steeltoedloafer/sets/72157637857661216/">seeing what my friend Ernie</a> was able to experience during his NASA Social trip, I knew I had to do one, and here's my chance.</p>

<p>What makes this trip to the Space Coast extra special for me is the homecoming feeling this trip has taken on over the last few weeks.</p>

<p>Growing up in South Florida, the space program was always prominently featured in school. In 6th grade our class had a unique opportunity to drive up to Titusville and experience a one day version of <a href="https://www.kennedyspacecenter.com/education/camp-ksc.aspx">Space Camp</a>. We had a lot of fun on that trip. During the bus tour portion I specifically remember passing a launchpad that had a Shuttle positioned and ready to launch within the next few days.</p>

<p>Prior to that 6th grade trip, in the mid to late 80s, my family would often visit my grandmother who lived in Titusville. Every once in a while we'd sit in her house and notice the windows begin to rattle just a bit. We all knew that meant NASA was launching a Shuttle that day.</p>

<p>We have another family member that worked for a NASA contractor doing quality control for the engines built for the Shuttles. We celebrated his 80th birthday this summer.</p>

<p>Later, in the 1990's when living in Miami, I vividly remember my family driving out of town to see the Shuttle travel across the sky during a night launch. It was amazing we could see a launch from that distance.</p>

<p>NASA and space travel was always an intriguing subject growing up. Getting a chance to go back to Titusville almost 20 years after my last visit for an even greater in-depth look at the space program is more than I could ever ask for. I can't wait!</p>
