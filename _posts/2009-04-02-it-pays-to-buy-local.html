<p>This story starts with a terrible experience using Amazon.com, and ends with a wonderful outcome at the local record store.</p>

<p>I was making an Amazon purchase and decided to throw in the new <a href="http://www.yeahyeahyeahs.com/">Yeah Yeah Yeahs</a> album. Well, after everything was all said and done I was going to end up paying $10.50 in shipping for a $9.99 CD. This was after I had to call into customer service on the phone to have my password reset. (Another rant for another day.)</p>

<p>So I knew anyone local could beat $20.49 for a CD. I went down to <a href="http://www.grimeys.com/">Grimeys</a>, paid $14 with tax and ended up with an EP that came with it.</p>
