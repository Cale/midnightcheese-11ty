<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

<p>Judging by the <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=1305">red curtain on the invite</a>, and the announcement taking place at a beautiful old <a href="http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/09.08.04/california-0437.html">theater</a>, I'd say <a href="http://www.apple.com/">they're</a> going to announce some type of video integration with <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a>. Maybe <a href="http://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a> meets iTunes in the form of h264 downloadable movies. Would definitely be a good use for those 30" displays.</p>
