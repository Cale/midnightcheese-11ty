<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

<p>I wanted to post some basic impressions regarding my first two months of my 24 month iPhone/AT&amp;T contract.</p>

<p>The bottom line being, it's pretty much not worth the cost and AT&amp;T could give a damn about their customers.</p>

<p><b>AT&amp;T</b><br />Compared to Sprint, AT&amp;T reception is terrible at my house. Even though I'm in 'Good' coverage on the map, I'm lucky to get 1 bar. Sometimes I have no service. I have to go outside to make important phone calls.</p>

<p>AT&amp;T prorates your first bill and charges you for the upcoming month of service you haven't yet used. Two weeks into using my new carrier I received a bill for $143. Charges included two weeks of service, a $36 activation fee (total BS), ~$10 of state taxes and about $18 of federal taxes, plus the fee for the next month of service that I haven't yet used. I'm on the $70/mo. plan.</p>

<p>I know technically and legally they can do it, but what a way to stick it right into your new customer's ass right from the start. When I cancel my contract in 22 months, will I get money back for the month I've already paid ahead? I'll be surprised.</p>

<p>So, AT&amp;T gets zero points for service, both product-wise and customer-wise.</p>

<p><b>Apple</b><br />It's pretty amazing this device can do what it does, but you can read about that elsewhere. With that said, I've never had a cellphone that can't keep time, but this one sure can't. I don't know if it's an Apple issue or an AT&amp;T issue, but this thing is off. And I mean randomly off. 46 minutes, 8 hours and 13 minutes... you name it. Random.</p>

<p><b>The G1</b><br />With the release of <a href="http://www.t-mobileg1.com/">Google's G1 on the T-Mobile</a> network today, I'm disappointed in myself for giving AT&amp;T my money.</p>

<p>The T-Mobile folks got up at the unveiling today and went on and on about opening up this platform. The whole thing is Open Source. That's really something special.</p>

<p>Apple puts out excellent software and hardware, and there are excellent apps available through their system, but there's still a good amount of freedom missing in that system.</p>

<p>Another thing that impressed me was when the T-Mobile rep said they would offer existing customers a benefit. (I don't remember the exact benefit, maybe an earlier release.) But that shows that they're at least actively thinking of their customers in a way that isn't just a moneygrab.</p>

<p>I think Android will turn out to be an excellent platform. I'm not big on the HTC phone, but more devices will come.</p>

<p>I hope in 22 months I'll be able to either move my iPhone over to the T-Mobile network, and if I'm lucky, have the option to put Android on my iPhone as well.</p>
