<p>Been busy the last couple weeks and just haven't had the time to post much. This past weekend I flew up to Massachusetts to see The Captain graduate from <a href="http://www.umassd.edu/">UMASS</a>. It's so weird to be able to drive through three states in an hour up there. Providence was very nice. Got to check out <a href="http://www.risd.edu/">RISD</a> and walk around Brown a bit. It was cold as balls up there, but still fun.</p>

<p>I recently saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371724/">Hitchhikers</a> again and really enjoyed it the second time around. It helps to see it again without any expectations. And of course I had to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121766/">Episode III</a> at midnight last Wednesday. It's certainly the best of the recent three, but it's still a Star Wars movie.</p>

<p>Aside from all that, just been busy doing a little freelance work. I hope to have some new work to share soon.</p>
