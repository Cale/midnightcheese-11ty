<p>Many people have noticed <a href="http://www.gap.com/">gap.com</a>, <a href="http://www.oldnavy.com/">oldnavy.com</a> and <a href="http://www.bananarepublic.com/">bananarepublic.com</a> have all been offline for quite some time. Turns out they've been busy reinventing online commerce, most notably by eliminating a lot of clicking when navigating through their websites. Instead of clicking back and forth between pages to view product details, all those details like price, size, and color all show up as a little rollover/popup window. There's a <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/240235_gaponline12.html">good article</a> at SeattlePI, along with a <a href="http://www.underconsideration.com/speakup/archives/002414.html#002414">write-up and screenshots of the new site in action</a>, at <a href="http://www.underconsideration.com/speakup/">SpeakUp</a>. This is certainly something all web designers and programmers should watch carefully.</p>
