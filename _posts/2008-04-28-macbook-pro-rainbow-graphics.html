<p>I was greeted with a screen of rainbow colors upon boot-up this morning. Many reboots later the problem still persisted. <a href="http://blog.durdle.com/archives/2007/11/30/macbook-pro-graphic-corruption/">This guy suggested</a> resetting the PRAM (Hold command + alt + p + r at startup, wait for two chimes) which worked perfectly.</p>
