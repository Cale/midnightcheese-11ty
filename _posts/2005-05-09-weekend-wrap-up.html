<p>Spent Friday evening at the <a href="http://blognashville.org/">BlogNashville</a> <a href="http://www.thursdaynightfever.com/2005/05/final_party_det.html">Welcome Party</a> down at the <a href="http://www.gaylordentertainmentcenter.com/index.shtml">GEC</a> associating many faces with the local blogshpere. Among others I had the pleasure of meeting the master of ceremony himself, <a href="http://www.thursdaynightfever.com/">Mr.Roboto</a>, <a href="http://vivalalesley.livejournal.com/">Viva la Lesley</a>, <a href="http://brittney.typepad.com/">Britteny</a>, and oddly enough, the <a href="http://lindadblu.blogspot.com/">LindaDblu</a> Fan Club.</p>

<p>Saturday I was able to catch up on a truckload of freelance work, before heading over to the Rents' for Sunday Mother's Day brunch. Between brunch and sending my little brother off for his first day of <a href="http://www.carmike.com/default.aspx">work</a>, a good majority of the day was actually spent with my Dad, driving all over Nashville shopping for shoes. We found none, but I did get to see the space that the <a href="http://www.apple.com/buy/">Apple Store</a> will soon be entering at the <a href="http://www.mallatgreenhills.com/">Green Hills Mall</a>.</p>
