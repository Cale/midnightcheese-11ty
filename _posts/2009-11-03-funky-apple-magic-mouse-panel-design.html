<p>I was reading the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2009/11/you-win-some-you-lose-some-a-review-of-apples-magic-mouse.ars">Ars review</a> of the <a href="http://www.apple.com/magicmouse/">Magic Mouse</a> and came across a screenshot of the new mouse's control panel. This is one of the few interface layouts from Apple that seemed to have almost zero thought put behind the design. Here's a little before and after of what I thought it should look like. Lots of simplification can happen here. Removing the separate checkmarks and drop-downs and replacing them with just drop-down menus really takes the business away from this panel. It's also more in line with the design of the Mighty Mouse and Spaces panels.</p>
