<p><a href="http://www.lavergne.org/">La Vergne</a> has opened a new <a href="http://www.lavergne.org/departments/police/index.shtml">Police</a> sub-station in the heart of the Lake Forrest neighborhood. This places a Police presence in the heart of a neighborhood that has been on the nightly news one too many times over the last several years.</p>

<p>City officials and the Police department are all standing behind this effort and I'm glad to see this activism come to our neighborhood, as we certainly need it.</p>
