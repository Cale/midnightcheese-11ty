<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

<p>A few months ago for my birthday I received an <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> board and a small 16x2 LCD screen. The Arduino is a lot of fun. It's taken several months of off-and-on tinkering but I finally have it setup to read in RSS and XML feeds from a PHP script and display the selected data on the screen.</p>

<p>I'll post the code soon, but first I wanted to just briefly go over actually attaching the screen to the Arduino. I ended up buying a <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=709">parallel screen</a> which requires quite a few more connection points compared to using a <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=9067">serial screen</a>. I used <a href="http://www.arduinoprojects.com/node/13">this wiring scheme</a> to hook-up the LCD. Finding the correct diagram for my screen took a little while of searching around the net, but once I found the right one everything worked well. (Sorry for the poor photo quality.)</p>

The 22 gauge wire fits snugly into the Arduino. Getting two wires into the same port is tricky, however.</small></p>
