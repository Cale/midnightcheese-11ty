<p>My Dad and I went to <a href="http://www.state.tn.us/environment/parks/SouthCumberland/">Savage Gulf</a> for some last minute fall foliage shots this weekend. The color was excellent, but unfortunately the height of the bluffs doesn't come through the photos very well. Savage Gulf is one of the more beautiful Tennessee parks I've been to. We hiked from Stone Door almost to the bottom of the canyon, but had to turn back due to time. Definitely want to get back to Savage Gulf soon.</p>
