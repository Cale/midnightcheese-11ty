<p>During the second Presidential debate a question was asked along the lines of, "What would you ask the American people to sacrifice to help further the good of the Country?"</p>

<p>Naturally, both candidates totally dodged the question. What they could have suggested were incentive-based recycling programs. For example, for every pound of recycled material turned in, the donor could receive a certain credit to spend at the grocery store. Something tangible to really encourage people to help out.</p>

<p>Obviously this would be very cost-prohibitive currently, but a program where you can save $1,000 and give it to the US Solar Program, the government would come out and install a 1Kw solar array on your roof.</p>

<p>I think if we were asked to do something worthy even without immediate incentive or reward, most people would take the time and energy to make that sacrifice.</p>
