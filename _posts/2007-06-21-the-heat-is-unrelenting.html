<p>It's 89 degrees in the office today which makes getting things done less than easy. As a result, here are a few things that have caught my eye today.</p>

<p>The new <a href="http://webkit.org/blog/108/yet-another-one-more-thing-a-new-web-inspector/">WebKit inspector</a> is all over the place  and a very fine inspector it is. Lots of visual goodness in terms of loading time and file size. Not to mention the excellent CSS browser.</p>

<p>I've been trying to use <a href="http://www.last.fm/">Last.FM</a>, but I must just not understand it. I open the player, search for tags, press play, and nothing happens. I keep getting 'There's not enough content to play... blah blah blah.' I must be doing something wrong. I want to like it and use it, but it mocks me.</p>

<p>On the way to work this morning I caught <a href="http://www.thepolyphonicspree.com/">The Polyphonic Spree</a> doing a cover of Nirvana's Lithium. At first I just said, "OMG, no... Why?" but once the chorus hit, I couldn't get enough. (Not surprisingly, this has been my reaction with their original songs as well.) I suggest giving it a listen.</p>
