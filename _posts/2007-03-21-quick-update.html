<p>Just a few things that have been standing out the last week or two.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> just keeps building and building. <a href="http://www.twittervision.com/">TwitterVision</a> pretty much sums it all up.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.codedig.com/blog/">Jimmy</a> just pointed me toward <a href="http://ubuntustudio.com/">UbuntuStudio</a> due in April. This is something that is probably great for enthusiasts and people who have never touched an image, audio or video manipulation application. But for anyone who is familiar with programs like Photoshop, After Effects or any of the pro video apps that Avid or Apple offer, this is not going to be usable. 10 minutes with the <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</a> is enough to say, &ldquo;<a href="http://thelinuxadvocate.blogspot.com/2006/08/gimp-vs-photoshop-what-still-needs-to.html">no thanks</a>.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/appletv/">AppleTV</a> is now shipping. You should be able to check it out at your local Apple Store this weekend. This has the potential to be iPod big.</p>
