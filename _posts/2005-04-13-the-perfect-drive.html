<p>It took two and a half years, but today on my way to work I was finally able to drive all the way down Nolensville Road from Old Hickory Blvd. to Thompson Lane without stopping at a single traffic light. Usually the light by Lowe's or the Harding intersection gets me every time. Today however, it was green the whole way through.</p>
