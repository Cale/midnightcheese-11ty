<p>I took advantage of <a href="http://www.rutherfordcountytn.gov/election/110408.htm">early voting in Rutherford County</a> today and decided to vote out all <a href="http://whoismyrepresentative.com/search/37086/">my representatives</a> that voted 'yes' for the Bailout Package.</p>

<p>An 'economic crisis' caused by bad debt, coupled with the largest money-grab in the history of existence, I just don't think plunging the country's deficit further into record debt was the answer. And it certainly didn't save the world's stock markets.</p>

<p>If we truly want to be Capitalistic and have a free market, the government shouldn't be bailing out these massive banks and institutions that are obviously run by people who have no forethought for future ramifications.</p>

<p>Also, the State buying stakes in banks is just a bit too Communistic for my tastes.</p>

<p>On the Prez front, I voted for Obama. I'm not big on his tax plan, but since our tax codes are already class biased, I don't feel completely terrible asking those who can afford to contribute a little more to do so. Honestly, if he asked me, being in the middle class, to pay another percentage or two more, I wouldn't mind doing it, if it truly meant that that extra money was going to fix the country in a real way.</p>

<p>Economics aside, I think Obama will be an adequate statesman representing our country. Something we desperately need. And to keep the current party out of the White House for a while I think will be good for us all. They've been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century">excessively power-hungry</a> the past several years in regards to increasing the reach and power of the Executive Branch. Not to mention human and civil rights issues... etc., etc...</p>

<p>Now we wait for the utter calamity to subside between now and November 4th. If we're lucky. It really truly isn't over until January 20th.</p>
