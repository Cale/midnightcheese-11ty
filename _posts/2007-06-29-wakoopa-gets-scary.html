<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

<p>I've been using <a href="http://wakoopa.com/">Wakoopa</a> for a few weeks now, and to look at <a href="http://wakoopa.com/cale/">how much time I've spent</a> on certain applications is starting to get scary. Seven hours manipulating code in Text Wrangler is crazy. Which is nothing compared to my Safari time. And that's only time tracked at work!</p>
