<p>According to the <a href="http://www.lavergne.org/mod/fileman/files/public-notice-wtp-violation.pdf">letter</a> (PDF) we received yesterday, this is actually a continuation of the same EPA violation from September of last year.</p>

<blockquote>The La Vergne System is currently in violation of the maximum contaminant level (MCL) for total <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trihalomethane">trihalomethanes</a> (TTHMs)...</blockquote>

<p>From what I've gathered, this means there is too much chemical by-product from the chlorine used to breakdown and treat organic matter in the water supply. THMs are considered carcinogenic.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.dnj.com/">Daily News Journal</a> goes into detail about past issues with the city of La Vergne and its water supply, including <a href="http://www.dnj.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080528/MICRO050101/80528016">failing to notify citizens of problems</a>.</p>
