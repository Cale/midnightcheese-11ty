<p>I was looking at the <a href="http://www.utk.edu/experience/walkingtour/">virtual tour</a> on the <a href="http://www.utk.edu">UTK</a> website and came across this page about a <a href="http://www.utk.edu/experience/walkingtour/NewFiles/TourUC.html">28 foot mural</a> that used to be displayed in the University Center. It's now permanently covered.</p>
