<p>I guess <a href="http://www.ezarchive.com/dodge77/AlbumSpace/88OGBCY5E5/the+white+stripes+-+walking+with+a+ghost.mp3">this track</a> has been out for a while now, but I just heard the White Stripes cover <a href="http://www.teganandsara.com/">Tegan & Sara's</a> Walking with a Ghost on XM this evening. Lots of people are hating it, but it sounds like a pretty straight forward rendition to me. If nothing else, Tegan & Sara must be thrilled.</p>

<p>Covers have always intrigued me. I'd say 99% of covers are unnecessary, but when extremely well known bands like the White Stripes cover a song from a much lesser known group like Tegan & Sara... to me that shows a great deal of respect that they must have for these girls.</p>
