<p>In 4 short months, <a href="http://learntoduck.com/micah/follow-friday">Follow Friday</a> on Twitter has morphed from a great way to showcase interesting people, to a gluttonous spamfest now resulting in people jamming as many screennames as possible into 140 characters over and over again all day long.</p>

<p><a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23followfriday"><img src="http://assets.midnightcheese.com/images/followfriday.gif" width="400" height="202" border="0" alt="#followfriday" class="blogImage" /></a></p>

<p>Follow Friday needs to get back to its roots. Choose <strong>ONE</strong> interesting person, post their name, and explain <strong>WHY</strong> they are worth following. That's it.</p>

<p>Remember: <strong>ONE interesting person per Friday and explain WHY</strong>.</p>

<p>P.S. Also, as an aside, rambling about your personal health problems is the quickest way to garner an unfollow. No one wants to read that. No one.</p>
