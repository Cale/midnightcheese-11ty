<p>Spent the weekend in K-town helping out with the <a href="http://www.utklug.org/">UTKLUG</a> <a href="http://www.utklug.org/index.php?p=2">Installfest</a>. Hours and hours of Linux which required not one, but two dinners to satisfy the hunger pains. Friday night went with Ernie and Rachel to see <a href="http://evervigilant.4t.com/">Evervigilant</a>. Pretty decent. Someone snapped up <a href="http://evervigilant0.4t.com/Photos/02-11-05/Jim%20And%20Trips-02-11-05.html">some pics</a>.</p>
