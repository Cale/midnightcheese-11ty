<p>Friday night <a href="http://steeltoedloafer.com/">Ernie</a>, Jeff and I were down in Georgia to meet up with <a href="http://gumball144.com/alex-roy/">Alex Roy</a> and a few of his other <a href="http://www.claytech.org/">fans</a>. Mr. Roy is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Roy">known</a> for his Gumball antics, but even more so for his record transcontinental drive from NY to LA in 31 hours and 4 minutes in his blue <a href="http://www.gumball144.com/polizei-m5/">BMW M5</a>.</p>

<p>A very nice guy, Alex was kind enough to sign my book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061227935?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=gumballrally1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0061227935">The Driver</a>, (a great read) and various car parts from other folks.</p>

<p>At the signing everyone was getting into nicknames when MidnightCheese was brought up. Alex said the 144 in Polizei 144 came from a cheese shop near his apartment that had 144 types of cheese on-hand. So this was most appropriate.</p>

<p>Here's my Flickr link to a few shots I took of his car, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/midnightcheese/sets/72157604423682484/">Polizei 144</a>.</p>

<p>Rumor has it Alex <a href="http://web.mac.com/clayhackett/ClayTech/The_Drive_%28Blog%29/Entries/2008/4/7_The_Atlanta_850.html">left Athens in a hurry that night</a>. Unfortunately, we ended up getting lost in Athens side streets before we could follow him out.</p>
