<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

<p>I've been wanting to redesign the entire <a href="http://www.midnightcheese.com/">site</a> for some time, but with so many little <a href="http://www.midnightcheese.com/2010/07/cable-modem-and-router-on-solar-power/">personal</a> <a href="http://www.midnightcheese.com/2010/07/garden-update-stunted-growth/">projects</a> distracting me, I've decided to let that want go for a while.</p>

<p>In the meantime I've gotten rid of the huge image of the rooftops and condensed the header down to something much less obnoxious. A good chunk of content is now visible without the need to scroll.</p>
