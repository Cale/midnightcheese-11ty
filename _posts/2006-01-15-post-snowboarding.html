<p>We ended up only being able to actually ski the Thursday night we got there. Rain came down all day Friday and it snowed all day Saturday with winds of 40-60mph. Much fun was had nonetheless. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/midnightcheese/sets/72057594048488016/">Pictures are up</a> on Flickr.</p>
