<h1 class="full-bleed">{{ title }}</h1><p class="date">{{ date }}</p>

<p>Today I discovered <a href="http://muxtape.com/">Muxtape</a> which is a quick way to throw together a mix tape of sorts by uploading MP3s to their website. Anyone can then go to your Muxtape page and listen.</p>

<p>Not sure about the legality of this one since they're storing unpaid for music on their server and letting others listen at no charge.</p>

<p>At the least, it's a good way for the site owners to build a massive MP3 collection of their own.</p>

<p>I posted two songs today on <a href="http://cale.muxtape.com/">my Muxtape</a>.</p>
