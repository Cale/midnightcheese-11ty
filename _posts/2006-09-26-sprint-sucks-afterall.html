<p>I bought and activated a new phone from Sprint back in May. This week, nearly 5 months later, I received my monthly bill that contained an $18 phone upgrade activation fee. A mistake? Oh no. Two customer service representatives assured me that it takes this long for activation fees to show up on billing statements.</p>

<p>It's a shame this happened, because up until now I had zero issues with Sprint for the past 4 years.</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> Oh, and Sprint is raising their data usage rates from $0.002 per KB to $0.03 per KB. But surely this has to be a typo. That means the 4,035 KB that I used last month that cost $8.07 at $0.002 per KB would now be $121.05 at $0.03 per KB. Surely, surely this is a typo. $121 for 4,035 KBs of usage would be insane.</p>
