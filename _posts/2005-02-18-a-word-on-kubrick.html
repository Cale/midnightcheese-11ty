<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

<p>First off, <a href="http://binarybonsai.com/kubrick/">Kubrick</a> is beautiful. It's great. The colors, the fonts, the minimalism of it all, I just love. Kubrick is so good in fact, that I'm almost scared to see what happens now that it's the <a href="http://binarybonsai.com/archives/2005/02/15/wordpress-15-released/">default theme in WordPress 1.5</a>. I'm worried that it's going to become so popular and abundant that it's going to become commonplace, dull, and no longer visually enticing. Maybe this is all just crazy-talk. I just don't want to see a good design go bad.</p>
