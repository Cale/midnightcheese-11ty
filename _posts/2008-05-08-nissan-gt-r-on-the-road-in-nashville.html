<p>Driving into work this morning I noticed a car some distance ahead with these tail lights that were terribly unique in their circular appearance. I sped up to catch the curious vehicle and as I hoped, came right up on not one, but two brand spankin' new <a href="http://www.nissanusa.com/gt-r/">Nissan GT-Rs</a> cruising down Murfreesboro road. One red, one a grayish color.</p>

<p>The cars had Tennessee Manufacturer/Dealer plates and judging by their route I'd guess they must have been shipped to the Nissan plant in Smyrna and were being driven up to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=nashville,+tn&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=36.162174,-86.777986&amp;panoid=AQCuZpaKHNiy6DH1daGiwg&amp;ll=36.163275,-86.777616&amp;spn=0.00699,0.007521&amp;z=17&amp;cbp=1,69.16415525376715,,0,-4.92126768992616">Nissan North America Headquarters</a> in downtown Nashville.</p>

<p>What amazing looking cars. The large diameter on the exhausts is unexpected, but noticeably imposing. The cars were being driven ultra conservatively (40mph in a 45) so I was unable to hear much from the engines.</p>

<p>I caught just a brief glimpse of the front of the red one, but not enough to really form an opinion. I followed behind them for several miles but ultimately had to turn off as they continued into downtown.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I didn't have my good Nikon with me, but here are a couple shots from my camera phone.</p>
