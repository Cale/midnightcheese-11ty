<p>I took a film class at <a href="http://utk.edu/">UT</a> (about 8 years ago, now) that required us to shoot several 16mm shorts throughout the semester. Of those several films, I finally <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-nbaeC5-BQ">posted</a> my favorite to YouTube.</p>

<p>The actor is my brother, Colin. Chris Conner did the score and opening title as a test project many years after the film was shot. The transfer to video didn't turn out too well, but that's what you get for videotaping film projected onto a wall.</p>
