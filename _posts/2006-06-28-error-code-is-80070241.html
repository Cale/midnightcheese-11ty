<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

<p>I signed up and downloaded the Vista Beta 2 ISO and was greeted with the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&client=safari&rls=en&q=vista+error+80070241&btnG=Search">popular 80070241 error</a>. <a href="http://www.tweaksforgeeks.com/windows-vista/2006/06/vista-beta-5384-install-error-code-80070241">Supposedly</a> I just need to re-download a non-corrupt ISO... Perhaps, if time allows. In the meantime, there's plenty of other people having their own <a href="http://binarybonsai.com/archives/2006/06/27/a-view-on-vista/">Vista issues</a>.</p>

<p>Edit 7.4.06 : Turns out it was a bad download. I redownloaded and reburned the ISO and Vista installed without issue.</p>
