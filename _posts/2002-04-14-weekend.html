<p>Ah, crunch time at the end of the semester begins. Lots due and very little time to work on it all. So I decided to "avoid" classes on Friday and head over to Cookeville to visit some friends from high school, before heading home to Nashville for the weekend. It was almost a completely unproductive weekend except for the final film I shot on Saturday for my cinema class. It should have been shot last weekend, but hey... what's the end of the semester without cutting things close?</p>
