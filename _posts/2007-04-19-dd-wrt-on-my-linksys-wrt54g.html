<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

<p>Last night after rebooting my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WRT54G">WRT54G v5</a> for the third time in less than an hour, I decided that was enough. Not to mention completely ridiculous. So this morning I said good-bye to the Linksys firmware and installed <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/What_is_DD-WRT%3F">DD-WRT</a>. Everything <a href="http://www.bitsum.com/openwiking/owbase/ow.asp?WRT54G5%5FCFE">installed</a> without issue and seems to be functioning. I've yet to hook it up to my home network, so the verdict is still out on true reliability. But so far so good.</p>

<p>The web interface is about 50 billion times better than the garbage that Linksys ships.</p>

<p>Lots of good information is provided as well. I can see uptime, load percentage, and even the signal strength of wirelessly connected devices. I was forced to install the micro version of DD-WRT due to the lack of RAM in version 5 of the WRT54G, but even this firmware is way beyond what the router shipped with. I'll post a reliability update once I get some actual traffic moving through the device.</p>
