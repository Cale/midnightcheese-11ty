<p>Our spring and summer gardens were met with a <a href="http://www.midnightcheese.com/2010/07/garden-update-stunted-growth/">bit of bad luck</a>, but I think our fall garden might actually work out. We've "grown" if you will.</p>

<p>As you can see, they're just sprouts at the moment, but already they've made better progress than our spring set; They produce noticeable growth day after day. These photos were actually taken on Monday and already the plants are almost twice as big today.</p>
