<p>When I was 12 I sent letters to a handful of TV stations across the country asking them to send back some type of promotional material with their logo on it. I recently came across all these logos in an old box and decided to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/midnightcheese/sets/72157603759220374/">put them up on Flickr</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/midnightcheese/2206933357/in/set-72157603759220374/"><img src="http://assets.midnightcheese.com/images/wbfs.jpg" width="200" height="219" border="0" alt="WBFS Logo 1992" class="blogImage" /></a></p>

<p>My favorite logo was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WBFS-TV">WBFS</a> channel 33 from Miami. It had that double 3D dropshadow action that didn't make any logical sense but was bold and very readable. I grew up watching way too many cartoons on that station after school everyday.</p> Transformers, G.I. Joe, etc.

<p>I also scanned in a pamphlet published by the National Association of Broadcasters called <i>Free TV</i> that really comes down hard on cable TV. They claimed with 75% of cable TV subscribers watching network shows during primetime, cable TV was basically useless. They also pointed out the high price of paying between $12 and $20 per month for television. If only the NAB could foresee what was to come.</p>
