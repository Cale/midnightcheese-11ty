<p>The webcam is up and working again. The drivers for the camera weren't working out on Linux, and I finally came across a driver for OS X, so now it's running natively under OS X rather than under classic under OS X. The <a href="http://webcam-osx.sourceforge.net/">driver</a> is by no means accurate, however, so the picture may be funky every now and then.</p>
