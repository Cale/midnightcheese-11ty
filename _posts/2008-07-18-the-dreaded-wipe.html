<p>It's about that time to do the ol' OS reinstall on my work machine. This is something I truly dread. Backing up and restoring files is fine, but reinstalling applications and getting all my settings and prefs straight is the tough part.</p>

<p>I could backup and restore all my pref files, but then you run the risk of the same issues continuing with the new install.</p>

<p>The two major issues requiring reinstall involve Adobe apps, naturally. Every day I turn on my computer Adobe wants to update Acrobat (which will let me print through the Adobe PDF printer). Well, the installer quits halfway through every time.</p>

<p>I've tried reinstalling Acrobat but the installer won't complete because I installed Fireworks CS4 Beta some time ago and it's looking for the Fireworks CS4 disk, which I don't have. (Fireworks CS4 crashed upon every launch so I never even got to use the software!)</p>

<p>And finally, Safari refuses to update to Flash Player 9. Safari is my default browser, but every time I come to a site that requires Flash 9 I have to open up FireFox.</p>

<p>So this may be an Adobe issue or it may be an Apple issue, but with Adobe's track record, I blame Adobe. All I can do is reinstall the whole thing.</p>
