<p>With all the iPhone speculation, I thought it would be fun to take a crack at what form such a device might take, and how it would function. Let's look at iPhone using the classic adage of "form follows function."</p>

<h2>Function - Information on the go.</h2>

<p>There's a big difference between the core function of an MP3 player and a phone. That difference is most notably: Push vs. Pull. An MP3 player pushes media (music, video, podcasts), while a phone actively pulls in information (meeting times, the latest gossip).</p>

<p>So, let's look at iPhone sans MP3 player. This means the device is all about communication and information.</p>

<p>Instead of "browsing the web," iPhone would probably function like a mini desktop computer with many different applications or widgets delivering specific information. Mini apps like a mail reader, and an RSS reader would be likely. This would also open up the possibility for other vendors to write applications for the iPhone. A Fandango movie time application/widget, and a Google Maps application, for example.</p>

<p>So, with the functionality of iPhone defined as an information device, how would such a device take form?</p>

<h2>Form - Simplicity</h2>

<p>iPhone would be a brick style phone, thin and about the size of an iPod. This eliminates moving parts like hinges that take up space and junk up the phone.</p>

<p>As an information device, you have to be able to read the information. A large screen would be in order, covering the entire front surface of the phone.</p>

<p>No physical buttons. A touch-screen would guide your way. (Think <a href="http://www.ted.com/tedtalks/tedtalksplayer.cfm?key=j_han">Jeff Hans' demonstration</a> on a smaller scale.)</p>

<p>A tiny pinhole on the back for the camera lens.</p>

<p>No physical plugs. Any accessory items would connect via Bluetooth.</p>

<p>No battery access. Customers that would buy an iPhone replace their phones so often, by the time the battery needed to be replaced, it would be time for a new phone.</p>

<p>The interface would be insanely simple. A mobile version of OS X with a desktop background and a scrollable dock of applications at the bottom of the screen.</p>

<p>No pen or stylus. Using those devices is akin to cross-stitching. Just simple scrolling movements and key presses using your fingers and thumb.</p>

<p>Of course, iPhone would easily sync with iCal and Address Book.</p>

<h2>What about the iTunes tie-in?</h2>

<p>This is where the latest iPod revision will enter. Think a Wi-Fi chip giving iPod the ability to buy music without the need of a computer.</p>

<p>We'll see what happens on Tuesday!</p>
