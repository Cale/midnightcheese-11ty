<p>I used the <a href="http://archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Internet/WWW/HTMLPrimer.html">NCSA Beginner's Guide to HTML</a> to make my first webpage ten years ago. It's very easy to read and follow along with. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in learning HTML. It's nice to know this wonderful guide is still around after all this time.</p>
