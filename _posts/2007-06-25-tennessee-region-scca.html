<p>Sunday I spectated at the <a href="http://www.trscca.com/">Tennessee Region SCCA</a> Solo 2 event at the <a href="http://www.nashvillesuperspeedway.com/">Nashville Super Speedway</a>. They featured a very wide range of participating cars, including a few Vettes, which up until then I had never seen any Corvette driver show off their power. Most Corvette owners are very reserved when you see them rolling down the interstate.</p>

<p>I think my brother and I will check out the next event in July. Hopefully after that I might have the nerve to run my car. It looks like some serious fun.</p>
