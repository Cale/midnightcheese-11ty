<p>Been trying to use <a href="http://www.google.com/glm/gmail">Gmail Mobile</a>, but <a href="http://www.geckobeach.com/cellular/reviews/samsunga660.asp">my phone</a> crashes and reboots every time I enter the URL. Makes me want a new cellphone even though I really, really, don't need a new phone. I really, really, don't need to be checking my <a href="http://gmail.google.com/">Gmail</a> on my phone either. Oh, but how badly I want to do so.</p>
