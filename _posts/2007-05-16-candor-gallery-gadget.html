<p>By popular demand, a <a href="http://www.candorgallery.com/">Candor Gallery</a> Gadget now exists for <a href="http://www.google.com/ig">Google Homepage</a> users. I think this was the best solution for users that aren't always in front of a Mac or who simply aren't Mac users at all. It's not as elegant of an experience as Dashboard can provide, but it's largely the same functionality. Creating the Gadget was fun. They're similar to <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/">Widgets</a> in that it's all HTML and Javascript. Gadgets keep everything in one file wrapped in an XML container. To install the Candor Gadget you can visit <a href="http://www.candorgallery.com/">http://www.candorgallery.com/</a> and click the "Add to Google" button or simply click <a href="http://fusion.google.com/add?moduleurl=http://www.candorgallery.com/xml/candor-gadget.xml">this link</a>.</p>
