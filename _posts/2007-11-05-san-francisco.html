<p>Merredith and I were in San Francisco the last 5 days. I've posted a bunch of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/midnightcheese/sets/72157602863336943/">photos from the trip</a> on Flickr.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=1881434262&context=set-72157602863336943&size=o"><img src="http://assets.midnightcheese.com/images/redwoods.jpg" width="400" height="266" border="0" alt="Redwoods" class="blogImage" /></a></p>

<p>The coolest part of the trip was probably seeing the redwoods at <a href="http://www.nps.gov/muwo/">Muir Woods</a>. It really is another world down there.</p>

<p>We stayed in Chinatown, visited the <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/">Computer History Museum</a>, ate at a ton of great restaurants, and pretty much ran all over the city.</p>

<p>Next time I'd like to drive down the coast and check out <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leviathor/287888614/">Julia Pfeiffer Burns park</a>. It was just too far out of the way for this trip.</p>
