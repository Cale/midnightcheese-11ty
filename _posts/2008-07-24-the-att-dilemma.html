<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

<p>My contract for cell service with Sprint has been up since May. Perfect timing for a July iPhone launch, but I'm still undecided.</p>

<p>The iPhone is an excellent device, but is it worth the potential pain of signing up with AT&T?</p>

<p>A buddy of mine was telling me about the ordeal with his iPhone purchase. He's been an AT&T customer prior to Cingular when they were AT&T once before. So apparently he had a nice credit due to him the next time he bought a new phone. Long story short, the credit was good for anything but an iPhone. Five conversations with five AT&T customer service supervisors wouldn't get him the credit. He wondered why new AT&T customers should be able to pay $200 for a new iPhone while faithful, long-standing AT&T customers should have to pay more.</p>

<p>Seems a valid enough concern.</p>

<p>(In this situation an Apple Store employee stepped up, providing the credit, putting his job at risk for doing so.)</p>

<p>Feels more and more that most behemoth companies like AT&T tend to place little value on existing customers. We see <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2008/07/24/comcastShutMeDownAgain.html">similar stories with Comcast</a>.</p>

<p>Is the fact that there are so many customers of a single company mean these stories are just bound to happen? Are the vast majority of customers happy and content?</p>

<p>I've been a Sprint customer since 2002. I never had an issue except for a $40 activation fee that showed up 5 months after activation. I called and spoke to 2 different people about it. They refused to do anything. What could I do? It would be a $150 fee if I decided to no longer do business with them. I know it could <a href="http://theridehome.wordpress.com/2008/04/07/putting-my-money-where-my-mouth-is/">always be worse</a>.</p>

<p>Regardless, they seem to win no matter what.</p>

<p>So what is one to do? You want the nice device, but how can you avoid the undesirable service provider? How can you send a message? Wait 4 more years when Apple will be out from under their contract with AT&T? As if both companies won't have already made the pile of cash they expect?</p>

<p>How many people would have to boycott a company as large as AT&T before things changed? What should change? Do people have the willpower to carry out something that massive, especially against a product like the iPhone?</p>

<p>Such is the AT&T dilemma.</p>
