<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/midnightcheese/sets/72157594228743661/"><img src="http://assets.midnightcheese.com/images/wwdc-2006.jpg" width="130" height="195" border="0" class="imageLeft" alt="WWDC 2006" /></a>There's been a lot of <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/columns/cultofmac/0,71557-0.html?tw=wn_index_23">press</a> about the keynote not being too hot, but from a <a href="http://developer.apple.com/">developer</a> point of view the rest of the week was great. (Well, judging from the first three days that I was able to attend, anyway.) Technically I'm not allowed to go into detail about the sessions, but I will say that Apple is doing a lot on the back-end to make development on their platform very easy.</p>

<p>The conference was an interesting event, especially having attended by myself. Everyone kind of kept to their own little groups, so breaking into conversation was a bit difficult. Other people that were attending solo tended to immerse themselves in their laptops inbetween sessions and even during the receptions.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it was interesting to peer into the Apple developer world for just a bit. The <a href="http://webkit.opendarwin.org/">WebKit</a> team was exceptionally "awesome" and "hot," as they tended to throw those words out quite a bit.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.candorgallery.com/">Candor</a> didn't get a mention at the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/ada/">Design Awards</a>. Obviously being the WWDC the judges were probably more interested in how the Widget worked in addition to what it actually did. So <a href="http://inventive.us/iCliplite/">iClip</a> was definitely deserving of that. Unfortunately Candor doesn't use any fancy <a href="http://developer.apple.com/corefoundation/">Core technologies</a> to get the job done.</p>

<p>So overall WWDC06 was a good experience, although oddly it was a bit isolating at times. It would be interesting to compare with something like MacWorld as I imagine you would probably get a much wider spectrum of Apple addicts at that event.</p>
