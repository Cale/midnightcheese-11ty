<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

<p>As a customer of DreamHost, (midnightcheese.com is hosted by <a href="http://www.aplus.net/">APlus.net</a>) I just don't feel confident in their services when I see images like this on their homepage. And this image is rather tame compared to some of the others that rotate through.</p>

<p><a href="http://assets.midnightcheese.com/images/dreamhost.jpg"><img src="http://assets.midnightcheese.com/images/fat-kids.jpg" width="350" height="252" border="0" alt="Livin' large at DreamHost" /></a></p>

<p>What kind of assumptions can we make from this photo?</p>
<ul>
<li>DreamHost employees are too busy living it up to worry about your hosting. </li>
<li>DreamHost is run by a bunch of overweight kids.</li>
<li>DreamHost is living large off your cash.</li>
</ul>

<p>I feel sorry for those kids, too. They need serious help with their weight or they're going to be in serious trouble in just a handful of years. They definitely don't deserve to be posted on the net like that.</p>

<p>I just don't get a feeling of professionalism from DreamHost anymore. And it seems to <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/134-on-writing-managing-disaster-at-freshbooks-dreamhost-dancing-trees">show</a> in their quality of service during the last few months.</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/287/dreamhosts-super-lame-no-i-mean-really-super-lame-apology">Red Sweater weighs in</a> on DreamHost's recent <a href="http://blog.dreamhost.com/2007/02/28/super-lame-apology/">super lame apology</a>. I think it's possible they've lost their minds.</p>
