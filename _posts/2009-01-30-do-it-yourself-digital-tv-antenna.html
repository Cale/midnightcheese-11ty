<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

<p>This weekend I'm going to attempt to build my own DTV/UHF antenna to be mounted in my attic, hopefully in time to watch the big game, over the air, on Sunday.</p>

<p>Ernie turned me on to <a href="http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2009/01/maker_workshop_dtv_antenna_steadyca.html?CMP=OTC-0D6B48984890">these instructions from Make</a>.</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> The antenna worked! Here are the <a href="http://www.midnightcheese.com/2009/02/dtv-antenna-success/">results</a>.</p>

<p>I've been using just a pair of rabbit-ears the last few weeks which actually work well with the digital TV signals. No adjustments needed between channels, although I am probably only 20 miles away from the majority of the towers in town.</p>

<p>Once the antenna is done we'll see if we can't pick up a little signal from some place further like Bowling Green.</p>
