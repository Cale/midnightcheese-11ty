<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

<p>It happened. I waited in line for about 45 minutes at the Apple Store in Green Hills on Saturday. (Three weeks after launch.) So far, the only thing I miss about my old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_SPH-A900">A900</a> was hacking it to tether to my laptop through Bluetooth. Sprint's EVDO network is rather speedy.</p>

<p>I feel weary giving my money to AT&T, but we'll see how it goes.</p>
