<p>According to <a href="ttp://sitening.com/">Sitening</a>, 150 people were lined up at the Green Hills Apple store around 2:30 this afternoon. They have <a href="http://sitening.com/blog/2007/06/29/live-from-the-iphone-launch-in-nashville/">photos of the event</a>.</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> It also looks like various companies are giving away products to those standing in line.</p>
