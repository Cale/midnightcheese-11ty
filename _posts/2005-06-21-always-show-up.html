At 5:00am on Friday I left for <a href="http://www.kingstontn.org/">Kingston</a> to appear in court for a speeding ticket I got back in March. My name was called, went up to the judge and he asked, "Were you speeding?" I said I was. He asked, "Do you live in Nashville?" (Implying, "Did you drive all the way out here from Nashville just for this?") I said I did. The Judge said, "DISMISSED." So it often pays to show up to court for your speeding tickets. I had to pay the fine, but it means no driving all the way back out to Kingston for traffic school, and most importantly, no points on my license or insurance rates going up.</p>
