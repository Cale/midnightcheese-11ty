<p>While it would be a lot of fun to set up a <a href="http://www.asciimation.co.nz/bb/2010/06/27/receiving-weather-satellite-pictures-in-new-zealand-part-1">weather satellite receiver and read signals from space</a>, cost and time begins to become an issue.</p>

<p>So, while reading about receiving sat. signals, I learned that <a href="http://www.noaa.gov/">NOAA</a> also <a href="http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/marine/radiofax.htm">broadcasts</a> various weather maps over shortwave radio for marine vessels. I just happened to have a little shortwave receiver and with the closest <a href="http://weather.noaa.gov/fax/gulf.shtml">NOAA Radiofax station in New Orleans</a>, I thought I'd see what I could pick up.</p>

<p>Using a piece of software called <a href="http://www.blackcatsystems.com/software/multimode.html">MultiMode</a> and with my radio tuned to 8503.9 kHz, I plugged my radio's audio out into my laptop's audio in, checked the <a href="http://weather.noaa.gov/pub/fax/PLEZ01.gif">broadcast schedule</a>, and waited to see what I could see.</p>

<p>With the built-in antenna the signal was a bit noisy, but you can see the outline of a map coming through. Not too bad. It takes a minute or two for each map to be received. You can see my results below. And below that is what the map is supposed to look like.</p>

<p>My next task is to try again using a proper antenna. With the ubiquity of the internet, it's fun to obtain data using these older methods.</p>
