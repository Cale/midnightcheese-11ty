<p>Should I really have expected anything less? I mean, seriously.</p>

<p>This is bad because it looks like the problem is either the Flickr or Twitter Javascript that IE is getting hung-up on. That means it's probably something not on my end, which means I'll probably have to code something that says, "Hey, if some fool is loading this page using IE, don't display this nice content because IE is nothing but a SAD SACK."</p>
