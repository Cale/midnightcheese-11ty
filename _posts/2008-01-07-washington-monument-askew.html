<p>I've always been bothered by the fact that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_monument">Washington Monument</a> isn't quite in line with the White House (orange line). It's placed in perfect arrangement between the Capitol Building and the Lincoln Memorial (blue line). The Washington Monument is almost in line with Virginia Avenue, but not quite (green line). It's just a tad bit off the grid enough to really, really make my brain hurt. If we could get some engineers out there and figure out a way to move it a few hundred feet West, I think that would really make everyone feel a lot better.</p>
