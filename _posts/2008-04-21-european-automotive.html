<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

<p>It's easy to use the ol' blog to point out the negative, but today I want to use it to throw out a little praise.</p>

<p>Anyone in the Murfreesboro/Nashville area looking to have work done on German autos should give <a href="http://europeanautomotives.com/">European Automotive</a> a call.</p>

<p>They were the third place I took the Jetta trying to get an exhaust issue taken care of. (Third time is a charm.) They were able to diagnose and fix the problem quickly and the Jetta has never run so well. Seriously, it feels better at 127,000 miles than it did at 36,000 when I bought it.</p>

<p>EA was super knowledgeable and several weeks later everything is still as it should be!</p>
