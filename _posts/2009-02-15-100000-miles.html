<p>I've officially put 100,000 miles on the Jetta since I've owned it. It took 5.5 years @ roughly 18,000 miles per year.</p>

<p>The car is actually running better now than it ever has, so I'm looking forward to many many more miles with it.</p>

<p>Here's a list of issues and repairs during the last 100,000 miles:</p>

<ul>
<li>Throttlebody replacement</li>
<li>Timing belt replacement</li>
<li>2 catalytic converter replacements</li>
<li>2 sets of tires</li>
<li>Several reattachments of the front underneith splash guard</li>
<li>Water pump replacement</li>
<li>Soon to be 2 sets of floor mats</li>
</ul>

<p>Probably couldn't ask for much less.</p>
