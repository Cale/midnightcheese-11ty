<p>Tomorrow I leave for a much anticipated spring break in Orlando. I got a truckload of stuff done yesterday to prepare: Finally(hopefully) got my car issue fixed by replacing the throttle body, got numerous chores done(dishes, trash, etc.), got the fishtank vacuumed out and replacement water put in, and even got a little freelance work furthered along.</p>

<p>Today I need to get the slow leak in my tire fixed, get vacation food for the fish, burn some mix CDs for the road, and pack everything up for tomorrow.</p>
