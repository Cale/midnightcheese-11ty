<p><a href="http://www.wkrn.com/">WKRN</a> held Video 101 on Saturday, giving a few local bloggers a crash course on videography basics. It was definitely a worthwhile event that included hands-on activities, discussion, and even critique led by two of WKRN's photogs, Joe Gregory and Mitch Jordan. We also got t-shirts and free lunch from Atlanta Bread Company, and you can't beat that.</p>

<p>I failed to bring my camera, but there are a few shots posted at <a href="http://donatacom.com/archives/00000941.htm">Terry Heaton's blog</a>, as well as <a href="http://www.nashvilleistalking.com/">Nashville is Talking</a>.</p>
