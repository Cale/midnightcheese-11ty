<p>This is interesting... <a href="http://www.pantone.com">Pantone</a> is now selling <a href="http://www.pantone.com/products/products.asp?idSubArea=0&idArea=7&idProduct=336&idArticleType_Products=0">bags</a>, and <a href="http://www.pantone.com/products/products.asp?idSubArea=0&idArea=7&idProduct=340&idArticleType_Products=0">notebooks</a>, among other things. And they're all color matched to a specific Pantone color with the number of that color printed on the side. It's like wearing a giant swatch on your back.</p>
