<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

<p>I was starting to get lots of unexplainable PHP error messages on the site recently, and rather than try to go through the hassle of fixing whatever might be wrong(it didn't seem to be a <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Answers-Trouble_Shooting#Headers_already_sent">whitespace issue</a>), I decided to just upgrade to <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> 1.5. So bear with the site as it slowly makes a transition into something that's not a template.</p>
