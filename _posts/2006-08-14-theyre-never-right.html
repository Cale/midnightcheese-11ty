<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

<p>Just before <a href="http://www.cbs.com/latenight/lateshow/">Dave</a> began I caught the end of the 10:00 news on <a href="http://www.newschannel5.com/">channel 5</a> and witnessed the <a href="http://www.newschannel5.com/content/bios/1731.asp">weatherman</a> say something to the tune of, "Rain is in the area, but there won't be any severe storms tonight!" So 20 minutes into Letterman channel 5 interrupts announcing severe thunderstorm warnings for Nashville and proceeds to track the storms.</p>

<p>If we can't predict 20 minutes into the future, how will weather prediction ever be as precise as it is in Back to the Future Part II?</p>
