<p>Early this past spring my Dad and I spent some time on a portion of the <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/tennessee/fiery-gizzard-trail-to-ravens-point">Fiery Gizzard</a> trail near Tracy City, TN. The trail is beautiful with several falls and huge 500+ year old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsuga">Hemlock trees</a>.</p>

<p>Nearby at <a href="https://tnstateparks.com/parks/south-cumberland">Grundy Lake State Park</a> are the remains of old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coke_(fuel)">coke ovens</a> from the late 1800s. Very interesting formations used in coal processing.</p>

<p>We were there early enough where very little foliage had sprouted. Going back during the fall or after a snowfall would make for great photo taking.</p>
