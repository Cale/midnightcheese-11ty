<p>Woke up around 4:30 this morning to the overhead fan rattling and what felt like the house vibrating. I assumed it was a plane from the Smyrna airport which is about a mile from the house. Never did hear any planes, however. I joked with Merredith saying it was an earthquake.</p>

<p>Turns out we were feeling a 5.4 quake located about 430 miles away in Illinois.</p>
