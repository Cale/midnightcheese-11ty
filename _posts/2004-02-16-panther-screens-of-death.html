<p>A good <a href="http://www.badapple.kustomrides.com/deathscreen1.htm">compilation</a> of Panther screens of death. My personal favorite is the "WTF Screen of Death." I've only ever encountered the "Grey Screen of Death" Myself. This is achieved by plugging an ethernet cable into a sleeping powerbook, wake, and BAM, Grey Screen of Death.</p>
