<p>This evening Merredith and I took a look at the posters on display at the <a href="http://nashville.aiga.org/events/2007/03/11888438">Sound and Print</a> show at <a href="http://www.mtsu.edu/">MTSU</a>. Every poster was just exceptional. We purchased a print from <a href="http://www.thedecoderring.com/">The Decoder Ring Design Concern</a> as well as from <a href="http://www.strawberryluna.com/">Strawberryluna</a> who just happens to be showing some of her work on <a href="http://www.candorgallery.com/">Candor Gallery</a>.</p>

<p>On the way out we cut through the University Center to get back to the car, and <a href="http://www.forgetcassettes.com/">Forget Cassettes</a> just happens to be playing with a couple other bands in what I assume is a lecture hall. So as we're passing a side door to leave, FC is about 10 feet to our right just playing away.</p>

<p>All this at MTSU, even. Very surreal.</p>
