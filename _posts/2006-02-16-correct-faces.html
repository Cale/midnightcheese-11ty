<p>Google has done something very cool, and that is make their ":)"smiley faces in Gmail Chat orient in the correct direction. I haven't seen this done since the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImagiNation_Network">Imagination Network</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Innface-alt1.gif">did it</a> back in the mid 90s. Very nice attention to detail. The animation associated with the smilies are a nice touch as well.</p>
