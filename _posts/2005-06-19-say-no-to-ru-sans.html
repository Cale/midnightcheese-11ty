<p><a href="http://blog.steeltoedloafer.com/">Ernie</a> and I went to <a href="http://nashville.citysearch.com/profile/38760219/nashville_tn/ru_san_s.html?cslink=search_name_noncust&ulink=search_2_searchslot1_520__0_profile_2_1">Rus San's</a> Saturday evening to get some sushi and check the place out. It was a nice lively place, but the service was horrid. Total, it took at least two hours to order, eat and pay. We were there a good 15 minutes before we even got our drinks, which was a good sign that things were only going to get worse. It took about an hour to finally get our food. Now, sushi isn't the most filling of foods, so once our initial order was consumed Ernie decided to order some fried rice. The waitress said it would take about 15 minutes. An hour later the fried rice finally shows up. And this whole time the waitress never asks if we'd like anything else to drink. We finished our second round of beer and had gotten through most of our water before the fried rice even showed up.</p>

<p>While the food was good, if you want sushi without the 120 minute ordeal, head over to your nearest <a href="http://www.publix.com/">Publix</a> and pick up a California Roll or two. Not only do they make em fresh, but the price is right as well.</p>
