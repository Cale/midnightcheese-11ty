<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

<p>A big thanks to the large, white, General Motors SUV that slammed their passenger door into my driver side door while parked at Cool Springs Galleria Friday evening. I have a good scratch along with a nice bit of white paint displayed on my door, now. Hopefully a little waxing will take care of everything. If you're lucky.</p>
