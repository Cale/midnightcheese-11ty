<p><a href="http://www.wolfmother.com/">Wolfmother</a> brought the house down last night at the <a href="http://www.exitin.com/">Exit/In</a>. <a href="http://www.themesshall.com.au/">The Mess Hall</a> opened with a two-man act that was actually quite good for there only being two guys out there on stage. Both bands came out at the end for a massive show-ending mash of noise.</p>

<p>Darren managed to position himself on stage and snapped a bunch of photos. Here are but a few.</p>
