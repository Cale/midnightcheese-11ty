<p>Just a quick round-up of small things.</p>

<p>Trying to get wine/<a href="http://darwine.opendarwin.org/">Darwine</a> running on the MacBook has been problematic. I've gotten <a href="http://www.winehq.com/">wine</a> to compile and Darwine will launch installers for certain applications, but thread issues have kept me from actually running anything. Others sem to have had <a href="http://forum.osx86project.org/index.php?showtopic=8699&st=100">success</a>, however.</p>

<p>The backend functionality for a widget idea is shaping up. Lots of good PHP action. I need to redesign the front-end and hopefully I can post something for testing purposes soon.</p>

<p>I had to breakdown and see how well the MacBook graphics card performed, so I installed <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/">World of Warcraft</a>. Needless to say, it's smooth as butter.</p>

<p>Merredith and I cooked up some spaghetti this evening that was fantastic. Excellent garlic bread as well.</p>

<p>The UTK E-Torch provided links to the <a href="http://bus.utk.edu/webcam/default2.asp">Glocker construction webcams</a>. The <a href="http://bus.utk.edu/NewGlocker/">final product</a> looks nice. The addition that stretches out in front of the stairs that lead to the Spam Building is interesting as well.</p>
