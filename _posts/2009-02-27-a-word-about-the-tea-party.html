<p>A lot of people are using this event as a continued outlet to blame one political party over another. People need to wake up and realize that it's the entire system that is at fault here. The two parties are essentially the same.</p>

<p>Do you really think if we had the other political party in office, they wouldn't be spending unfathomable amounts of money right now?</p>

<p>Politicians at the Federal level exist to move money. They control the flow of money and it's their job to get as much money to their friends/constituents as possible.</p>

<p>Remember: We need to change the system as a whole. Both parties are to blame.</p>

<p>This potential rabbit-hole of a post could go on forever, but I'm going to cut it off here.</p>
