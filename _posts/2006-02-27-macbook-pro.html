<p>And there was much rejoicing heard throughout the land.</p>

<p>My new laptop arrived this morning! I've got more pictures to post, and a more in-depth report of Photoshop running under Rosetta coming soon. For now, after using my old PowerBook G4 for almost 4 years, the MacBook Pro is FAST. Very Fast. iPhoto is smooth and silky. Photoshop 7 running under Rosetta performs noticeably faster than Photoshop 7 running native on the 800mhz G4. Much faster than I had imagined.</p>
