<p>I've been wanting to build some type of container for my <a href="http://www.midnightcheese.com/2010/03/hooking-up-a-parallel-lcd-to-arduino/">Ardiuno/LCD combination</a> for some time. A couple weekends ago I finally bought some plexiglass and machine screws and made it happen.</p>

<p>The plexiglass is more fragile than I expected. It's extremely scratch prone and cracks easily with just a slight bit of pressure. Scoring and snapping was actually the easiest part of dealing with the plastic. Drilling holes produced small cracks on more than one occasion.</p>

<p>Eventually I  got it right and now the <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> and its components have a solid base to function on.</p>
