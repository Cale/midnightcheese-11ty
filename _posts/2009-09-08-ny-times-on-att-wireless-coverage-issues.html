<p>Last week the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/03/technology/companies/03att.html">New York Times ran an article</a> featuring <a href="https://www.wireless.att.com/">AT&T's wireless</a> coverage problems. Several times I've written about the <a href="http://www.midnightcheese.com/2009/06/att-coverage-still-stinks/">AT&T coverage problems</a> experienced at my house.</p>

<p>The NY Times article basically blames the AT&T network. It's just not robust enough to transfer larger amounts of data demanded by iPhone and other smartphone users. The release of the iPhone has largely exposed this vulnerability.</p>

<p>In my experience, at certain events where several thousand people are amassed all at once, AT&T data service becomes almost non-existent. I noticed this a couple times last year, once at the <a href="http://www.roadatlanta.com/ev_petit.lasso">Petit Le Mans event</a> near Atlanta, and again at the <a href="http://www.ameliaconcours.org/">Concours d'Elegance</a> near Jacksonville. Voice calls worked well, but data connections were not happening at all. So get a couple thousand people around a single AT&T cell tower, and you've got serious data fail.</p>

<p>It all seems to come down to bandwidth. With a lack of bandwidth it's obvious why AT&T is delaying MMS and tethering options for the iPhone.</p>

<p>Although my issues at home are due to a <a href="http://www.midnightcheese.com/2009/06/att-coverage-still-stinks/">weak signal</a>, I'm still plagued by lack of a data connection and dropped calls.</p>

<p>It's probably time for another call to AT&T customer service.</p>
