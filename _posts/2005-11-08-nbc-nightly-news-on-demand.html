<p><a href="http://www.nbc.com/">NBC</a> began offering <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032619/">Nightly News</a> to viewers online, yesterday. I enjoy watching the nightly network news, but I'm usually at work or driving home at 5:30 when the show airs. So this is great for us 9-5ers in the Central Time zone. M$NBC is even offering a Mac feed, now. Good for them. Earlier today you had to be running IE 6 or you got nothing.</p>
