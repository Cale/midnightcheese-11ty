<p>The posts have been slow, but I've been working on the backend side of things getting ready for a new Midnight Cheese refresh.</p>

<p>Currently the site is a hacked version of <a href="http://binarybonsai.com/wordpress/kubrick/">Kubrick</a> with a few CSS changes and some of my own graphics thrown in. Not to mention the design was put together when I was just learning CSS.</p>

<p>So I'm starting from scratch this time from a naked Wordpress Install. I have the basic design and structure done. The major work that's left is filling in all the CSS gaps that are missing.</p>

<p>I hope to have things done in a couple weeks. Sooner if I'm lucky.</p>
