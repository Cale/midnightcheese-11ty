<p>I just ran across <a href="http://www.people.virginia.edu/~jac3he/">Jim's page</a> while going through my site stats. (Jim was my RA for a year in college.) His site is looking quite good. I have no doubt that it's largely a result of his recent acquisition of one of the <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/">greatest machines ever produced</a>. I also noticed that Jim has set up his <a href="http://www.people.virginia.edu/~jac3he/Images/DesktopFullSize.png">desktop</a> with quite possibly the smallest <a href="http://www.apple.com/pro/training/macosx_basics/segment102663.html">Dock</a> I have ever seen.</p>
