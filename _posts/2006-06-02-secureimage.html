<p>With the bombardment of roughly 45,000 comment spams in the last few days I finally found what will hopefully be a nice solution to end the madness. <a href="http://uberdork.supertwist.net/2005/03/13/plug-it-in-plug-it-in/">SecureImage</a> is an easy little plugin that you can drop into your WordPress plugins folder and it automatically generates random text within an image that each poster must enter as a security code.</p>

<p>Spending time each day deleting several thousand comment spams is just ridiculous.</p>
