<p><a href="http://www.midnightcheese.com/wx/">10KWX</a> is a responsive weather app that I submitted to this year's <a href="http://10k.aneventapart.com/">10K Apart</a> exercise.</p>

<p>The app uses a web browser's <a href="http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html">geo location feature</a> to grab the user's location and then pass that info off to <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/weather/">Yahoo!'s weather API</a> for current conditions and forecast.</p>

<p>To fit within the 10K file size limit, use of images was out of the question. But, what's a weather forecast without a nice graphical indicator of the weather? Using the HTML5 canvas element and CSS3 animation I was able to render the graphics and the subtle animation of each weather illustration. (Be sure to check in during a thunderstorm.)</p>

<p>Having done quite a bit of animation in Flash and After Effects, CSS3 animation techniques are actually a welcomed way of doing things. I love being able to specify keyframes as percentage points.</p>

<pre><code lang="css">
@-moz-keyframes rain1 {
  0% {
    margin-top: 0px;
    margin-left: 0px;
    opacity: 0;
  }
  20% {
    margin-top: 6px;
    margin-left: -4px;
    opacity: .55;
  }
  80% {
    margin-top: 54px;
    margin-left: -36px;
    opacity: .55;
  }
  100% {
    margin-top: 60px;
    margin-left: -40px;
    opacity: 0;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>One bug(?) I found with CSS3 animation was not being able to span values across multiple percentage breaks. For example, looking at the animation above, I originally didn't have the top and left margin values written out on the 20% and 80% marks, just the 0% and 100% marks. But, this caused some funky animation to occur, especially on the iOS version of Webkit. Adding top and left margin to the 20% and 80% points solved this problem. The only downside: It requires calculating those margin values at that specific percentage point.</p>

<p>This project was a lot of fun. Surprisingly time consuming, but that happened to be a good thing.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="http://visitmix.com/labs/ai2canvas/">Ai->Canvas</a> is a great plugin for converting Adobe Illustrator shapes to a canvas object.</p>
