<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

<p>This morning I dealt with the happiest post office staff I have ever seen. The whole experience was surreal. I walked in at 8:45 and expected, as always, the line to be out the door. There was one person in line. The people behind the counter were friendly, and genuinely happy to be doing what they were doing.  They were courteous! I think I may still be dreaming.</p>

<p>I did notice, and this is another matter that I suppose has turned up since  9/11, that the people at the PO are very interested in what you're shipping and receiving. If they don't flat out ask you what's in your package(which they have done to me many times) they try to bring it up in conversation very sly-like. Today when I picked up my package the guy behind the counter says, &ldquo;MASSACHUSETTS, EH?&rdquo; Like he's never seen a package from so far away so there <b>must</b> be something non-Kosher in that box. I just nodded and said, &ldquo;YES.&rdquo;</p>
