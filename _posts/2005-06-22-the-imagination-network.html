<p>Wow.. just stumbled across this entry on Wikipedia for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImagiNation_Network">Imagination Network</a>. That really brings back the memories. INN was a friendly little online community which started in 1991, before AOL was huge and before the world even had any idea what the internet was. INN ran in DOS, dialing in at a smokin' 2400 baud rate. What made INN so unique was the wonderful people that made up this community. Imagine a place where you could connect without spam, without risk of being bombarded by crazy internet people... Just nice friendly people you could chat and play games with, without consequence.</p>

<p>What happened to INN you ask? In 1996 as AOL began its surge toward the ungodly behemoth of the online cesspool it is today, <a href="http://www.att.com/news/0896/960806.bsa.html">AOL bought INN</a> and SHUT IT DOWN. Bastards.</p>
