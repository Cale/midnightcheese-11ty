<p><a href="http://www.kinkos.com/">Kinkos</a> sure has gone down hill. Aside from no longer being open 24/7, their "computer lab" area looks like it's being pahsed out as well. I went in to scan a drawing... The scanners are tiny, there was only one <a href="http://www.apple.com">Mac</a>, two Dells, and the Mac didn't even have a zip drive. The scanner on the Mac wasn't working either. Sounds like a conspiracy to me.</p>
