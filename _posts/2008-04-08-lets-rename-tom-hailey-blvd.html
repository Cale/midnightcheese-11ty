<h1 class="full-bleed">{{ title }}</h1><p class="date">{{ date }}</p>

<p>The street we live on is named after a <a href="http://lavergne.org/">La Vergne</a> city official (codes) who was <a href="http://www.wsmv.com/video/15819334/index.html">recently suspended</a> for <a href="http://dnj.midsouthnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080403/NEWS01/804030339/1002">using racial slurs at work</a>.</p>

<p>This is what I get to think about now when addressing letters and filling out forms that require my address.</p>

<p>Just when you think La Vergne can't bottom out any further, it somehow manages.</p>

<p>And how does a current sitting official get a street named after him?</p>
