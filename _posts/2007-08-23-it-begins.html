<p>I just glanced at the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/rankingsindex">preseason college football rankings</a>. USC #1 in both the AP and USA Today polls. Seriously? A team that fell apart at the end of last season? A team that only has 3 ranked teams on its <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/teamsched?teamId=30">schedule</a>? And none of those three ranked teams are in the top ten? Where do you get #1 from that? #1 on the list of easiest schedule in the country? Sure. USC is becoming the <a href="http://www.midnightcheese.com/?p=409">next Notre Dame</a>.</p>
