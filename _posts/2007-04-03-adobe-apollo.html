<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

<p>I spent half a day last week playing with <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/">Flex</a> and the new <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Apollo">Adobe Apollo</a> runtime. Flex was fun once I figured out the proper syntax for referencing XML data. The Flex scripting language is tag based, similar in structure to XML, but obviously with quite a bit more power. An interesting &ldquo;feature:&rdquo; Flex doesn't connect directly to a DB, but only to an XML data set.</p>

<p>You have to install an Apollo add-on to Flex to publish Apollo applications, but once that's done the process is a fairly painless &ldquo;export&rdquo; dialog.</p>

<p>As an example, I published a little <a href="http://www.candorgallery.com/flex-test/CandorApollo.air">Apollo application</a> that reads in XML data from <a href="http://www.candorgallery.com/">Candor Gallery</a>. Obviously this is all alpha software, but my example was less than cross-platform as the <i>Refresh</i> button only works on OS X systems.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, from a development view, Apollo looks promising. Getting users to download the Apollo runtime will be another issue.</p>

<p>Download the <a href="http://www.candorgallery.com/flex-test/CandorApollo.air">Candor Gallery Apollo app</a>. There's also a <a href="http://www.candorgallery.com/flex-test/CandorTest.html">Flex version</a> that doesn't require the Apollo runtime. Flash Player 9 is required, however.</p>
