<p>Found my Kinko's post linked on this <a href="http://www.tommygibson.com/kinkossux.html">anti-Kinko's site</a>.  I have to say the last few times I've had to deal with Kinko's(always in a last resort situation), they've done a pretty shoddy job; Colors on their printers uncalibrated, printouts coming back with the layout shifted completely off from what it should be. Pretty bad. I think if they just hired some people with a little bit of a print/design experience they wouldn't get so many complaints.  They're usually good at discounting for any mistakes, however.</p>
