<p>On the way to work this morning I ended up behind a <a href="http://www.ford.co.uk/ka/">Ford</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Ka">Ka</a>. They're not sold in the U.S., so it was surprising to see a car I didn't recognize and then once I got close enough, have it turn out to be a Ford. They're definitely in the mini class... very much like a Geo Metro. There were two people in the car, so I didn't even think to look and see what side the steering wheel was on.</p>
