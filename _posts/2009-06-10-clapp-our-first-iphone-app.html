<p><a href="http://jumzies.com/">Jimmy</a> and I have published our first iPhone app called <a href="http://clapp.jumzies.com/">Clapp</a>. It's super simple. Clapp plays 3 different types of clapping noises for use at any event that warrants a hardy clap.</p>

<p>It's about as minimal as it gets, but we wanted to get something published just to go through the process. Now it's on to something bigger and better! Ideas are welcome. ;)</p>
