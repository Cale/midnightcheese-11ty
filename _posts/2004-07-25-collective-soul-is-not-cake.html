<p><a href="http://www.collectivesoul.com/home.html">Collective Soul</a> was at <a href="http://www.dancininthedistrict.com/">Dancin' in the District</a> last night. They sound pretty good live. I was glad I got to see them. They asked the audience to sing along, but only once, not obsessively, over and over again like <a href="http://kimberry33.diaryland.com/eatitbiotch.html">Cake is known to do</a>.</p>
