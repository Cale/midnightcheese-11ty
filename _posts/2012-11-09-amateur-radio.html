  Because I'm not already leading a completely geek-filled lifestyle between my
  <a href='http://myemma.com'>day job</a>
  and my time on
  <a href='http://jawgrind.com/'>Jawgrind</a>
  discussing the merits of original Star Trek episodes, I decided to seal the deal and get my ham radio license.
</p>
<p>The process of getting my license kind of happened by accident. My grandfather was a ham (K9PSA) and I always remember seeing his radio setup as a kid, but I never really put together what it was all about. Last year I accidentally stumbled upon a form of data transmission popular in the ham world that allows people to transmit text across great distances with an extreme minimum of transmission power.</p>

  The idea of transmitting messages across states and countries sans-internet is interesting, but the visual aspect of
  <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSK31'>PSK31</a>
  that allows you to literally see the data flowing through a block of spectrum is intriguing. So I had to try it myself.
</p>
<p>Over the last several months I've been using a little RadioShack shortwave receiver to view the transmissions, and now that I finally have my license, I hope to be transmitting soon.</p>

<p>I passed both my Technician and General tests in March and received KK4HSX as my call sign. Now I've begun to slowly put a rig together. Recently I picked up an Alpha Delta antenna and mounted it to the highest point in the attic. With a length close to 40 feet, it fit perfectly stretching from one end of the attic to the other.</p>
<p>
  While saving up some dough to get a decent radio for that antenna, I've been playing around a bit on the local repeaters with a little
  <a href='http://www.kenwoodusa.com/Communications/Amateur_Radio/Portables/TH-K20A'>Kenwood TH-K20A</a>
  FM transceiver. I even enlisted my Dad's help in building a larger (j-pole) antenna to plug into that little handheld. Still trying to find some time to properly test that thing out.

<p>That just about sums things up for now. I'm sure many more amateur radio related posts will follow this one.</p>
