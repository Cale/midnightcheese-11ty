<p>I had the opportunity to geek out with <a href="http://trey.cc/">Trey</a> and <a href="http://about.me/stephenwyattbush">Stephen</a> on the <a href="http://jawgrind.com/post/9729604918/episode-2-stephens-moustache">lastest episode of Jawgrind</a>. We had a lot of fun talking about all things web related: <a href="http://www.vimconf.org/" title="VimConf">VimConf</a>, <a href="http://www.getskeleton.com/" title="Skeleton Boilerplate">Skeleton</a>, <a href="http://10k.aneventapart.com/" title="Responsive Web Design in 10K of code">10K Apart</a> (I'll be posting my project soon), bookmarking sites, <a href="http://html5weekly.com/" title="HTML% Weekly">HTML5</a> and <a href="http://javascriptweekly.com/" title="Javascript Weekly">JavaScript Weekly</a>, Rails 3.1 and much more. Alcohol may have been involved.</p>

<p>Stephen and Trey are much more talented in the world of web dev than I, so it was great to sit-in and learn a thing or two. <a href="http://jawgrind.com/post/9729604918/episode-2-stephens-moustache">Give Jawgrind a listen here</a>.</p>
