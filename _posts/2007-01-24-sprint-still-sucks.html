<p>Sprint has a <a href="http://valentines.sprint.com/addaphone/?id12=CHP_MyPCS_Billboard_Val_Jan14">special</a> running on their website where you can add a line to your plan for $9.99 and choose between two free phones. Merredith and I want to be on the same plan, so I call Sprint to run through the options over the phone. This way I can ask them a bunch of questions, mainly making sure they don't <a href="http://www.midnightcheese.com/index.php?p=412">charge me a random activation/upgrade fee</a> 4 or 5 months down the line again.</p>

<p>So I talk to the rep on the phone and get everything squared away when all of a sudden I'm informed that they can't offer me that deal with that particular phone over the phone. "It's not a tele-sales promotion." I'll have to process the order over the web. What?? I ask again, "You can't process this for me over the phone?" "No," they respond, "That must be done online. We can't help you."</p>

<p>What kind of customer service is this? This is the most asinine requirement. I bet if the CEO or anyone else above middle-management knew this was going on, this would never be happening. I've called two different reps and both have said the same thing. That's twice I've called Sprint, willing to give them money for a service, and they've denied me because the reps can't process the order over the phone. Unbelievable.</p>
