<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">OS X</a> is the most stable and elegant OS I've ever used. Unfortunately, about the only thing it's good for right now is surfing the internet. I still have to use OS 9 to do anything productive. Or to play games for that matter. OS X is cool, but it needs apps! Specifically Adobe apps.</p>
