<p>On my continuing quest to learn how to code I've created a fun little application that lets you vote and rank the <a href="http://trendme.me/">current Trends</a> from <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>. The application is called <a href="http://trendme.me/">TrendMeme</a>. In addition to voting, you can see what's currently being said about a Trend, comment on a Trend and even search and browse for past Trends.</p>

<p>Furthering my PHP abilities I used the <a href="http://cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a> framework to construct this app. I learned a lot about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">MVC process</a>. CakePHP has its oddities (the SUM function is largely absent) but overall I think it's a solid tool and it was very helpful.</p>
