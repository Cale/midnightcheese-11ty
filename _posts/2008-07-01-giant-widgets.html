<p>Driving into work I've noticed more and more of the digital billboards showing up. Today I passed one that was displaying the 5-day weather forecast. It was so odd to see a billboard with <i>current></i> information. It was like a giant life-sized <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/">Dashboard widget</a> that popped up on my windshield. Kind of surreal.</p>
