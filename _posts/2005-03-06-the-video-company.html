<p><a href="http://www.tvcnashville.com/">The Video Company</a> website went live this weekend. I think overall it turned out well. It's completely <a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> CSS and XHTML compliant, weighing in at 388K not including the downloadable PDF documents. I kind of wish we had developed the logo before the site design, just so the two would tie in a bit better. Maybe a bit more flash on the home page. My favorite page is the <a href="http://www.tvcnashville.com/directions.html">directions page</a>. For whatever reason I really enjoyed drawing out the maps. I think they look very clear and informative.</p>
