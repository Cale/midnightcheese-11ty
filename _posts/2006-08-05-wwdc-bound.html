<p>Well, in less than 24 hours I'll be in San Francisco for the much anticipated <a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/">WWDC 2006</a>. <a href="http://www.candorgallery.com/">Candor Gallery</a> has been entered in the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/ada/">Apple Design Awards</a>, so I figure this will probably be the best excuse I'll have to go to one of these conferences.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to some great things being announced at the Keynote... No doubt we'll see the Mac Pro introduced, along with a tasty preview of Leopard. For Leopard, maybe a tabbed Finder and a redesigned UI that begins to lose the bubbly gloss look? After all, their hardware no longer sports the multi colors and the bulbous shapes either.</p>

<p>Perhaps we'll see Apple negate the work of <a href="http://www.codeweavers.com/products/cxmac/">CodeWeavers</a> and the <a href="http://www.alkyproject.com/">Alky Project</a> allowing users to run Windows apps straight-up in Leopard.</p>

<p>Will there be one more thing? Maybe a sneak peak at the new wi-fi enabled iPods due out for X-mas? I'd like to see the iPods sport an RSS reader that lets you update your feeds at any wi-fi hotspot.</p>

<p>But aside from the keynote there will be some great <a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/sessions/desc-p.html">sessions</a> and of course the Apple Design Awards Ceremony. I can't stay for the whole week so I'm going to miss some <a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/specialevents/">good stuff</a> like the widget sessions on Wednesday and the Campus Bash on Thursday, but I'm sure 3 days will be plenty of Apple overload.</p>

<p>San Francisco by itself will have plenty to offer. Hopefully I can hit up the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/prsf/">Presidio</a> and check out the new <a href="http://www.lucasfilm.com/inside/letterman/">Letterman Digital Arts Center</a>. If I have time Wednesday I'm going to try and drive down the coast a couple hours and see what <a href="http://parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=578">there is to see</a>.</p>

<p>There's been interest expressed to blog the Keynote live, but I don't know how feasible that will be. Besides, I want to see what's going on on-stage rather than staring at my notebook screen the whole time. But we'll see. There will certainly be plenty of other <a href="http://www.macrumorslive.com/web/">sources</a> for live Keynote updates.</p>

<p>Anyway, at the least I'll certainly be posting some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/midnightcheese/">photos</a> as the trip progresses, so check back for that!</p>
