<p>Ahahahaha!! It's done! D-O-N-E DONE. I finished up my thesis yesterday, burned it all to CD, and it's now ready to go off to the printer!! How about that? I've still got a process book, some kind of <a href="http://web.utk.edu/~design/sshow01/">show</a> display, and a bunch of resumes to get to work on, but hey... I'll worry about that in a couple weeks. ;)</p>
