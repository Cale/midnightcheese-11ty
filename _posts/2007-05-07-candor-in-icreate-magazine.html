<a href="http://www.candorgallery.com/">Candor Gallery</a> has been included in the most recent issue of <a href="http://www.icreatemagazine.com/">iCreate Magazine</a> on the free software and resource CD that comes bundled with the magazine. iCreate is full of how-to articles relating to mostly consumer applications created by Apple. (iDVD, iWeb, iMovie, etc.)</p>

<p>It's very exciting to have Candor "published." Issue #41 will be on newstands in England for another 3 days, but should be available in the U.S. for a few weeks longer.</p>
