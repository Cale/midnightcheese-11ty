<p>When you spend 10 years in the same school system you get used to seeing the same things over and over. Much like the school system logo that's on top of every notice and announcment that they send home with you for your parents to look at year after year. I was looking at my <a href="http://www.dadeschools.net/">old school system's website</a> tonight and noticed that they changed their logo. Here's the <a href="http://web.utk.edu/~rmooth/dcps.jpg">old one</a>. And here's the <a href="http://www.dade.k12.fl.us/information/Graphics/color_linear.jpg">new one</a>. It's kind of sad in a way. From kindergarden to my 1st year of high school I recognized that DCPS logo. And now it's all changed. Ahh.. only to be back in K-12 again. ;)</p>

<p>I also took a look at my <a href="http://www.dade.k12.fl.us/smiami/">old high school's webpage</a>. Ahh...Memories.. that's <a href="http://www.dade.k12.fl.us/smiami/SA/SAmain.htm">where</a> it all started.</p>
