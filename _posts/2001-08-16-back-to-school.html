<p>Well, it starts all over again tomorrow for one final performance. I'm headed back to <a href="http://www.utk.edu">school</a> later this afternoon for my senior year. Hopefully it will be a wonderful fun filled year. So far things look promising. Ended out the summer with a great weekend trip to Florida... and today, one last summer movie with Andy. Sounds good. Everything is set in motion... let's see what happens! See you all in <a href="http://www.theknoxvilledirectory.com/">K-town</a>!</p>
