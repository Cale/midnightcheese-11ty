<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

<p>Whew... okay... I think I finally got this whole <a href="http://www.noahgrey.com/greysoft/">Greymatter</a> program working out. I finally reached my last straw dealing with <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a> earlier this week. One too many times their service was interrupted or down or whatever... So I'm going to try and use Greymatter from now on. It's nice because the entire program runs on your own website, so you never have to worry about the service being down. Unless your site is down, of course.</p>
