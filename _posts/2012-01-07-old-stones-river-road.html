<p>If you look at the <a href="http://g.co/maps/4vhf6">Percy Priest Lake area on Google Maps</a> you can often see old roads that lead straight into the water. Recently I noticed such a road parallel to Stones River Road here in La Vergne, and this past fall Merredith and I decided to take a walk to see what we could find.</p>

<p>It turns out there was quite a bit to see of Old Stones River Road. From small drainage bridges to old fencing to the actual roadbed, it looks as though the road was left as-is when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_priest_lake">Percy Priest Lake</a> was built in the 1960s. The following photos were taken just south of the Hurricane Creek boat ramp area.</p>
