<p><a href="http://www.candorgallery.com/">Candor</a> has been given an update. Version 1.2 now includes a <i>previous</i> button so users can easily see the last image that was displayed.</p>

<p>With a lot of help from <a href="http://steeltoedloafer.vox.com/">Ernie</a> and his stellar PHP skills, we've created a <a href="http://www.candorgallery.com/gallery/">web gallery</a> that displays all the works that have been included in Candor.</p>

<p>And a smaller detail: The widget will now pop up a little notification when a new version of Candor has been released. This should avoid having to send email out to a large list of current participants.</p>
