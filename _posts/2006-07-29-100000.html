<p>I hit the 100,000 mile mark on my car on the drive home from Clerks II last night. I've had the car since July, 2003 @ 37,000 miles, which means I've put on 63,000 miles in 3 years. 21,000 miles per year. Will the car last another 5 years and hit 200,000 miles?</p>

<p>Also, <a href="http://www.clerks2.com/redband/large.html">Clerks II</a> was the best movie of the summer so far.</p>
