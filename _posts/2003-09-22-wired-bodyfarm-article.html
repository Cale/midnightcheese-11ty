<p>Going to <a href="http://www.utk.edu">UT</a> everyone always heard of the <a href="http://wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,60403-2,00.html">BodyFarm</a>, but I for one never realized how small of an area it was and how close it was to campus! I expected it to be way out in the mountains someplace far far away. Nope. It's right next to the University Medical Center employee parking lot.</p>
