<p><a href="http://www.newschannel5.com/global/Category.asp?c=92320">Channel 5</a> broadcast the local news in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hdtv">HD</a> this evening. The best looking part of local news in HD? Probably the weather maps. Lots of detail and bright color.</p>

<p>They don't seem to be shooting field footage in HD, but it is in widescreen. They also did a story on the rise of HDTV sales. Sadly the story was shot in SD. They also tried to show an SD and HD TV set side-by-side for viewers to compare. Well... if you're watching on an SD set, it's pretty much impossible to tell a difference now, isn't it?</p>

<p>So the same idiocy exists, but now it's in high-res! Yay!</p>

<p>Here are a few screenshots. Clicking the images will load high-res images at 720P. Here's one in <a href="http://assets.midnightcheese.com/images/snapshot_j_20070202_0009.jpg">full 1080i</a>.</p>
