<p>I turned on <a href="http://www.cbs.com/latenight/lateshow/">Letterman</a> for the first time in a long time and was delighted to see <a href="http://www.cbs.com/">CBS</a> finally broadcasting the show in HD. He looks a bit older with all that extra detail, but still my favorite late-night personality, nonetheless.
