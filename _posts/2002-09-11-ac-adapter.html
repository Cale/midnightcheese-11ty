<p>Anyone know where I can get a <a href="http://www.lowendmac.com/pb/150.shtml">Powerbook 150</a> AC Adapter that doesn't cost a trillion dollars like on <a href="http://www.midwestmac.com/page34.html">some sites</a>? (BTW... Diet Mountain Dew Code Red is the best diet drink I've ever tasted. It's still terrible, but as far as diet goes, at least it has a little bit of flavor... unlike all the others.)</p>
