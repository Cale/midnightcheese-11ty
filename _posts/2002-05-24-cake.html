<p>Ahhh... tonight was the first <a href="http://www.dancininthedistrict.com">Dancin' in the District</a> of the season. It was quite the fantastic show. <a href="http://www.cakemusic.com/">Cake</a> and <a href="http://www.superdrag.com">Superdrag</a> did a great job. I think Cake got a little carried away with trying to get the crowd to sing along... the show was a little late getting started... none of the stage lights worked for half the show, and <a href="http://www.tennessean.com/local/archives/02/05/17877847.shtml">Nashville burned down</a> in the background as the bands played in the dark, but all in all, the music was good and that's what counts.</p>
