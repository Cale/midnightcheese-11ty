<p>This is <a href="http://tennessean.com/local/archives/04/07/55298124.shtml">nothing</a> <a href="http://www.nashvillescene.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?story=Back_Issues:2004:August_5-11_2004:News:Editorial">new</a>, but now that <a href="http://www.nespower.com/">NES</a> has started cutting trees in the neighborhood I work in, I thought I'd post a pic to show just how ridiculous they've gotten with the trimming. I mean... yeah, it would be nice not to have the power go out in an icestorm due to limbs bringing down the powerlines, but I think most people would rather pay a little extra to replace downed powerlines than have their trees and neighborhoods look like this. And how often does Nashville have a serious icestorm, anyway? This is disgusting. NES is making Nashville look like a wasteland. Who wants to live next to a tree that looks like that?</p>
