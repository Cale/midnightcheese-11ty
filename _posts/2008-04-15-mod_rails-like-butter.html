<p>Jimmy pointed me to <a href="http://www.modrails.com/">Passenger</a> (mod_rails) which is by far the easiest way to deploy a <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> app through <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a>.</p>

<p>Simply install Passenger (single command install, nonetheless) and point Apache to the folder that contains your Ruby on Rails app (DocumentRoot /your/cool/folder/) and you're done.</p>

<p>Restart Apache and your Rails app is running. This is amazingly simple after dealing with <a href="http://www.lighttpd.net/">lighttpd</a> and some of the others.</p>

<p>I set this up on my home Ubuntu server and am now in a daze of awe.</p>
