<p>I talked to a friend of mine on the phone the other night for nearly an hour. I realized later that I haven't had a lengthy phone conversation like that in ages. Since I communicate with most of my closest friends via IM, (sometimes even while sitting in the same room) it was fun to have just a normal conversation over the phone. It also reminded me of growing up before cell phones and computers were everywhere, just sitting at home on the telephone(cord and all) talking to my best friend for lengthy amounts of time.  How communication has changed.</p>
