<p>Lots of good stuff this weekend. Did the Art Crawl on Saturday and saw a lot of <a href="http://www.tagartgallery.com/">good work</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.grindhousemovie.net/">Grindhouse</a> is worth every single over-priced penny to see a movie these days. Seriously, the best movie I've seen in a long time. It's just so over-the-top. It's hilarious. And you can't beat a double-feature.</p>

<p>Installed beta 3 of <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/beta/fusion/">VMWare Fusion</a>. Less taxing on the CPU with the debugging turned off. It also ran <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/">Fedora</a> 7 test live, although 3D acceleration must only be working with Windows at the moment.</p>

<p>I also received my poster for this year's <a href="http://art.utk.edu/graphic_design/gallery/sshow07/">Senior Show</a> featuring the seniors in the <a href="http://art.utk.edu/graphic_design/">Graphic Design program</a> at the <a href="http://www.utk.edu/">University of Tennessee</a>.</p>
