<h1 class="full-bleed">{{ title }}</h1><p class="date">{{ date }}</p>

<p>This is <a href="http://www.kevchino.com/index.aspx?review=880">exactly the kind of review</a> I've been hoping to read regarding the new <a href="http://www.yeahyeahyeahs.com">Yeah Yeah Yeahs</a> album, Show Your Bones, which is due to be released today. I can't wait for my copy to show up in the mail! That band is something else...</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> Finally got the album. Btw, if you're looking to purchase new releases through Amazon, don't. Titles show up waay past the release date. Anyway, the album is good. It's very different, but good. It's like they got expensive equipment and a studio, and actually sat down and thought about what they were doing. So it loses that raw edge that the first album had, but the music is still very very well done.</p>
