<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/1219303@N25/">NaNoDrawMo</a> <a href="http://stevenf.tumblr.com/post/219998282/neven-and-gus-both-expressed-interest-in">requires</a> its participants to create 50 drawings in 30 days. I've had a little empty sketchbook sitting around for some time now that I thought would be perfect for this exercise. I'm doing quicker sketches rather than finished drawings which seems to fit better in the smaller space of the book.</p>

<p>I started with some renderings of objects but have started to move into faces and characters. More to come!</p>
