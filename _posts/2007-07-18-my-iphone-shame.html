You haven't touched one yet...</p>

<p>Do it at lunch... shameful...</p>

<p><b>Cale</b><br />
No, I think we're going to run over to [the Apple Store] at lunch tomorrow</p>

<p><b>Ernie</b><br />
Today.</p>

<p><b>Cale</b><br />
I know... we're going to be the last people walking in there to say OMG how awesome! And the Apple people are just going to be like, "Lamers...."
Then they'll say, "You have to leave now." and we'll be shamed</p>

<p><b>Ernie</b><br />
They will. The rest of the crew can assume the shame but you were an Apple owner before the iMac.</p>

<p>Shamed.</p>

<p>Big time.</p>

<p>I shame you.</p>

<p><b>Cale</b><br />
I've received a call from an iPhone... does that count for anything?</p>

<p><b>Ernie</b><br />
No.</p>

<p><b>Cale</b><br />
dammit</p>

<p><b>Ernie</b><br />
I called myself with an iPhone, when you can say that... half shame lifted.</p>

<p><b>Ernie</b><br />
If you buy an iPhone on the spot, the rest of the shame is lifted, otherwise you will have to live with iPhone half shame for the rest of your life.</p>
