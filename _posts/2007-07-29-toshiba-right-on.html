<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

<p>Merredith bought a laptop several months ago with XP preinstalled but was eligible for a Vista upgrade DVD to come in the mail at a later date. So the DVD arrived with plenty of warning: "For Toshiba computers only." I put the disk in my desktop machine and upon autoplay a dialog box shows up saying, "For Toshiba computers only." Just for the heck of it I ran the setup program direct. Long story short I have Vista installed on my desktop.</p>

<p>Not that Vista is anything worth mentioning, but the lame attempt by Toshiba to keep people from putting that Vista upgrade on anything but Toshiba product was awesome.</p>
