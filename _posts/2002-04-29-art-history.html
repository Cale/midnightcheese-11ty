<p>Bah... I spent 3 hours studying for my <a href="http://pr.utk.edu/undergrad/Courses/ArtHist.htm">art history</a> final which is on Friday. How is it that I pass all my 400 level class with flying colors, but I'm in danger of not getting credit for a freshman 100 level class? What's going on here??</p>
