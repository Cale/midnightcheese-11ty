<p>The "Late Night" shows have always been my favorite TV shows to watch. As a kid I'd watch Carson and Letterman, and after Carson retired it was Letterman and Conan.</p>

<p>Leno did a good job but I was always a Letterman fan.</p>

<p>I always felt Letterman got a bad deal not getting the Tonight Show after Carson left. Letterman was obviously Carson's favorite.</p>

<p>Conan is great, because like Letterman, is able to come to the celebrity guests as a more of an outsider who doesn't mind calling them out on their obsurdities.</p>

<p>So with Letterman and Conan coming on at the same time, it's really going to be unfortunate to have to split my time between the two.</p>

<p>Jimmy Fallon has been on for a few months now. He's getting better and it's great how he involves the audience in the studio and viewers at home through the internet. And what he's doing with Twitter is great. Friday night, after Leno's final show, Fallon Twittered along with his show, kind of like a director's commentary. It was quite dynamic and very interesting. There are some brutally awkward moments, though. Especially between him and his announcer. But his show is still very new, and has a lot of time to develop.</p>

<p>Here are some classic clips of Letterman on Carson. Letterman was really fired up back in the day.</p>
