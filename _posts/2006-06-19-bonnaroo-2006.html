<p>I was lucky enough to attend <a href="http://www.bonnaroo.com/2006/">Bonnaroo</a> with my Dad for the day on Saturday. What an amazing experience. 80,000 people all in one place all attending to have a good time and listen to some great music. No conflicts, no aggression. Everyone was equal.</p>

<p>So much great music all weekend. I was able to see Beck, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiohead">Radiohead</a>, and Dr. John on Saturday. Radiohead was amazing. They played  for well over 2 hours. Thom Yorke was exceptionally graceful not saying much more than a quiet "thank you" after each song.</p>
