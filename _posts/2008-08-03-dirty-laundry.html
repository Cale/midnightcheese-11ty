<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

<p>I recently came across this old parody from the early 1980's of the network news and the newsmakers of the day. I'm told this was originally put together by some folks at CNN when the network was first coming on the air. The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6fOKYAs8pE">video</a> is set to Don Henley's 'Dirty Laundry.'</p>
