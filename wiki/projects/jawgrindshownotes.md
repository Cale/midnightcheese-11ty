What is Spock wearing?

Peace and Tranquility. Peace of the factory and tranquility of the machine. -Spock

This is a soulless society, Captain.
It has no spirit, no spark.
All is peace and tranquillity--
the peace of the factory, the tranquillity of the machine,
all parts working in unison.

Well, you're on your own now. I hope you're up to it! -Kirk
